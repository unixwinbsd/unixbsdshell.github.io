Security is very important in this digital age. Network protocols like Invisible Internet Protocol or I2P, a network layer that allows you to remain anonymous on the Internet. With I2P, your request passes through several network computer nodes. This makes it difficult to track the original user and helps maintain anonymity. Because of I2P sometimes you can also access government censored sites anonymously.

I2pd or i2p daemon is an open source i2p client based on C++. It is an anonymous network layer where communication is encrypted and the user's IP address is not revealed. Started in 2014 by the [PURPRLEI2P](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd) team and first released in 2015. This technology is designed to be more secure, reliable and perform better than I2P.

In the previous article, we have written about [I2P running on the OpenBSD system](https://penaadventure.com/en/openbsd/2025/02/16/how-to-install-i2p-routing-protocol/). You may ask, what is the difference between I2P and I2PD. Well, to clarify the discussion above, we will try to explain between I2P and I2PD.

[I2P](https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/net/i2p/pkg/DESCR) is an anonymous overlay network, a network within a network. It is intended to protect communications from surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs. I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, and ordinary people. No network can be “truly anonymous.” The ongoing goal of I2P is to make attacks increasingly difficult. Its anonymity will only get stronger as the network grows in size and with continued academic review.

Meanwhile, [I2PD](https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/net/i2p/pkg/DESCR) is a full-featured client for the I2P network written in C++. I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is a universal anonymous network layer. All communication over I2P is anonymous and end-to-end encrypted. Participants do not reveal their real IP addresses to each other. Both peer-to-peer (cryptocurrency, file sharing) and client-to-server (websites, instant messengers, chat servers) applications are supported.

## 2. i2pd Installation Process
After you know a little about i2pd and the system used, we will go straight to installing i2pd. Oops.... wait, before you install i2pd, there are some dependencies that you must install first.

### a. I2P Installation Guide
The first dependency you have to install is I2P. In this article we will not explain how to install I2P on OpenBSD. Just read the installation process [in the previous article](https://penaadventure.com/en/openbsd/2025/02/16/how-to-install-i2p-routing-protocol/).

### b. Install cmake boost miniupnpc
The next dependency you need to install is cmake boost miniupnpc.

```
ns2# pkg_add cmake boost miniupnpc
```

### c. Install I2PD
After all the above dependencies have been installed, we continue by installing i2pd.

```
ns2# pkg_add i2pd
```

## 3. i2pd Configuration Process
This part is a very important part, because we will tinker with the i2pd file so that it can run on the OpenBSD server. The main i2pd configuration file is located at **"/etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf"**. Please open the file and change it according to your OpenBSD system needs or specifications. To make it easier, just follow the guide below.

> /etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf

```
## Configuration file for a typical i2pd user
## See https://i2pd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/
## for more options you can use in this file.

## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.

## Tunnels config file
## Default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.conf or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf
# tunconf = /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf

## Tunnels config files path
## Use that path to store separated tunnels in different config files.
## Default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.d or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.d
# tunnelsdir = /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.d

## Path to certificates used for verifying .su3, families
## Default: ~/.i2pd/certificates or /var/lib/i2pd/certificates
# certsdir = /var/lib/i2pd/certificates

## Where to write pidfile (default: /run/i2pd.pid, not used in Windows)
# pidfile = /run/i2pd.pid

## Logging configuration section
## By default logs go to stdout with level 'info' and higher
## For Windows OS by default logs go to file with level 'warn' and higher
##
## Logs destination (valid values: stdout, file, syslog)
##  * stdout - print log entries to stdout
##  * file - log entries to a file
##  * syslog - use syslog, see man 3 syslog
# log = file
## Path to logfile (default: autodetect)
# logfile = /var/log/i2pd/i2pd.log
## Log messages above this level (debug, info, *warn, error, critical, none)
## If you set it to none, logging will be disabled
# loglevel = warn
## Write full CLF-formatted date and time to log (default: write only time)
# logclftime = true

## Daemon mode. Router will go to background after start. Ignored on Windows
## (default: true)
daemon = true

## Specify a family, router belongs to (default - none)
# family =

## Network interface to bind to
## Updates address4/6 options if they are not set
# ifname =
## You can specify different interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6
# ifname4 =
# ifname6 =

## Local address to bind transport sockets to
## Overrides host option if:
## For ipv4: if ipv4 = true and nat = false
## For ipv6: if 'host' is not set or ipv4 = true
# address4 =
# address6 =

## External IPv4 or IPv6 address to listen for connections
## By default i2pd sets IP automatically
## Sets published NTCP2v4/SSUv4 address to 'host' value if nat = true
## Sets published NTCP2v6/SSUv6 address to 'host' value if ipv4 = false
# host = 1.2.3.4

## Port to listen for connections
## By default i2pd picks random port. You MUST pick a random number too,
## don't just uncomment this
port = 4567

## Enable communication through ipv4 (default: true)
ipv4 = true
## Enable communication through ipv6 (default: false)
ipv6 = false

## Bandwidth configuration
## L limit bandwidth to 32 KB/sec, O - to 256 KB/sec, P - to 2048 KB/sec,
## X - unlimited
## Default is L (regular node) and X if floodfill mode enabled.
## If you want to share more bandwidth without floodfill mode, uncomment
## that line and adjust value to your possibilities. Value can be set to
## integer in kilobytes, it will apply that limit and flag will be used
## from next upper limit (example: if you set 4096 flag will be X, but real
## limit will be 4096 KB/s). Same can be done when floodfill mode is used,
## but keep in mind that low values may be negatively evaluated by Java
## router algorithms.
# bandwidth = L
## Max % of bandwidth limit for transit. 0-100 (default: 100)
# share = 100

```

### a. Enable I2PD
Then we continue by enabling i2pd.

```
ns2# rcctl enable i2pd
ns2# rcctl restart i2pd
```

### b. Creating I2PD Boot
In this section, you can manually start I2Pd, but it will not start automatically
when the system boots. This section explains how to do this. The first thing to do is create a new login class to increase the number of files that I2Pd can open simultaneously.

By default, OpenBSD limits this number to a value that is too low for I2Pd to work properly. Symptoms of too low a number include difficulty connecting to websites and high CPU usage. If you are using OpenBSD 7.5 or later or a newer OpenBSD, simply add the following line to the /etc/login.conf.d/i2pd file to create the login class.

> /etc/login.conf.d/i2pd

```
i2pd:\
    :openfiles-cur=102400:\
    :openfiles-max=102400:\
    :tc=daemon:
```

### c. Running I2PD
After you activate i2pd, we continue by running i2pd. To run i2pd we use the Google Chrome web browser or others. In the address bar menu you type "http://192.168.5.3:7070/".

If you don't miss any of the configurations above, an image like the one below will appear on your monitor screen.

I2PD can be a very useful tool if you want to stay anonymous on the internet and increase your security while browsing. This tool has all the features of I2P and improves on them. It is more secure, cryptographically encrypted, and more performant since it is built in C++. If you have some sites that are censored in your country, I2PD can help you access them anonymously as well.

Therefore, this tool is useful for people like journalists, news agencies, or general users who want privacy. This tool is very flexible and can be used in various applications. We recommend visiting its official website and analyzing the pros and cons of using it. This tool can certainly increase privacy and anonymity, but you should not rely on it. I2PD is still under development and is constantly being updated to improve.
