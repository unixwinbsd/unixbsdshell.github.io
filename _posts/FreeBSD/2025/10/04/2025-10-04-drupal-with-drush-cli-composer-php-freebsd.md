One of the reasons why Drupal is the favorite CMS in the world is the community's quick response to the shortcomings and weaknesses of a version so that they can be repaired more quickly by the Drupal community or developers. Between one version and another, there are usually unique additional features that attract users or developers to explore further.

The update or upgrade process requires careful consideration, but the important thing is that the goal of both (update/upgrade) must be achieved with good and maximum results. It is also necessary to ask what the purpose of the process is. Whether to increase Drupal performance, improve security or just switch versions. If the reason is for security reasons then it is very mandatory for a Drupal website developer to update to the recommended or safer version.

In our opinion, the Drupal update process must still be carried out, why? because, when you first install Drupal, usually many menus cannot be used, only the admin menu runs normally, while the other menus need to be updated.

In this article we try to explain the Drupal update process using the Drush CLI and Composer. Usually we carry out this update process after installing Drupal.

## 2. Drupal Update Process

Before you update Drupal, first check the Drupal version, so that the update process can be seen whether it was successful or not. Use the "drush status" command to see which versions of Drupal and Drush are active on your FreeBSD server.

```
root@ns3:~ # drush status
Drupal version   : 10.0.0
Site URI         : http://default
DB driver        : mysql
DB hostname      : localhost
DB port          : 3306
DB username      : userdrupal
DB name          : drupal
Database         : Connected
Drupal bootstrap : Successful

Admin theme      : claro

PHP config       : /usr/local/etc/php.ini

Drupal root      : /usr/local/www/drupal10
Site path        : sites/default
Files, Public    : sites/default/files
Files, Temp      : /tmp
```

We will update Drupal version 10.0.0 to version 10.2.2. Follow the guide below which will update Drupal to the latest version.

### a. Update Drupal Database

As we know, all Drupal data is stored on the MySQL database server. The first step you have to do is update the Drupal database with the command below.

```
root@ns3:~ # drush updatedb
root@ns3:~ # drush cache:rebuild
root@ns3:~ # drush config:export --diff
```

Apart from using the drush command above, you can also update the database with a web browser. Type the following command in Google Chrome `"http://192.168.5.2/drupal/update.php"`.


### b. Backup Drupal Database

Before you update Drupal, make a habit of always doing a `"backup"` first. This backup file really helps you if an error occurs during the update process. Follow these steps to backup a Drupal database.

```
root@ns3:~ # drush sql:dump --debug
root@ns3:~ # drush archive-dump --exclude-code-paths=sites/default/settings.php --debug
```

After that, you have to activate maintenance mode, the goal is that all your Drupal website data cannot be opened temporarily.

```
root@ns3:~ # drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1
```

The final step is to do the `"rebuild cache"` command.

```
root@ns3:~ # drush cache:rebuild
```

### c. Update With Composer PHP

After the Drupal database has been updated and backed up, you can continue with the update process. Use composer to carry out the Drupal update process.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/www/drupal10
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-all-dependencies
```

Next, you update the Drupal database again then clear the cache.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush updatedb
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush cache:rebuild
```

If you use configuration management to deploy Drupal configurations, be sure to export the configuration. Run the following command to export the configuration.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush config:export --diff
```

After you have carried out all the processes above, normalize your Drupal website again with the following command.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 0
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush cache:rebuild
```

Before you see the results, run the following command.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # composer install --no-dev
```

Nach, now let's see the results of all the commands you have done above. Run the command `"drush staus"`, have you succeeded in changing the Drupal version?

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/drupal10 # drush status
```
