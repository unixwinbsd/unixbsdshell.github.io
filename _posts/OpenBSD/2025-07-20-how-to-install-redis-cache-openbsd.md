Redis is often referred to as a data structure server. That is, Redis provides access to mutable data structures through a series of commands, which are sent using a client-server model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So, multiple processes can request and modify the same data structures in the same way.

Redis can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD operating systems. Redis caching is commonly used on client sites and many large companies such as Gatsby, WordPress, Nextcloud, and others use Redis as memory caching. As an in-memory cache, it handles traffic spikes very well.

## A. What is Redis Cache?

Caching is essential to ensure a fast and smooth user experience in the digital world by storing frequently used data in fast-access storage. Caching minimizes data retrieval time and reduces backend load, allowing web applications to scale and handle high traffic volumes efficiently. Essentially, caching contributes to the responsiveness and scalability of a web platform.

[Redis](https://www.liquidweb.com/blog/redis-as-cache/#:~:text=Redis,%20while%20capable%20of%20functioning,the%20performance%20of%20your%20website) is one of the most popular key-value databases, ranking 4th in user satisfaction for NoSQL databases, Redis’ popularity continues to grow, and many companies are looking for Redis developers for roles such as database administrators, etc. Redis is a popular, fast, and open-source in-memory data store that is used as a database, cache, and intermediary between site visitors and site administrators.

At its core, Redis operates by storing data in key-value pairs, making data retrieval very fast and efficient. When used as a cache, Redis temporarily stores frequently accessed data that would otherwise be expensive to retrieve or compute repeatedly. Here’s how it works:
- **Data Fetching:** When an application requests data, it first checks the Redis cache.
- **Success or Failure:** If the requested data is found in the cache (cache hit), Redis returns the data immediately, significantly reducing latency. If the data is not in the cache (cache fail), the application fetches the data from the primary database.
- **Data Storage:** After fetching the data, the data is stored in the Redis cache, so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served faster.

Redis client-side cache is also known as “tracking”, since Redis is a data structure-based solution, caching in Redis can be strings, hashes, lists, sets, or sorted sets. This cache uses streams and many other data structures, and you also need to know that reading and writing to the cache requires the use of GET and SET commands in Redis.

## B. How to Install Redis on OpenBSD
You can start installing Redis on OpenBSD with the ports system or with the available PKG packages. Most OpenBSD users prefer to install packages with PKG. You can follow each command below to start installing Redis.

```
ns2# pkg_add pecl82-redis
ns2# pkg_add redis
```
### a. Redis Configuration
The main redis configuration file is located in "/etc/redis", which consists of the files:
- redis.conf, and
- sentinel.conf

You change the script in the redis.conf file according to your needs and OpenBSD system specifications. Below is an example of the **"/etc/redis/redis/redis.conf"** file, which we have adjusted to the needs and OpenBSD system we are using.

```
bind 127.0.0.1 -::1
protected-mode yes
port 6379
daemonize yes
requirepass router123
tcp-backlog 511
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
unixsocketperm 770
timeout 0
tcp-keepalive 300
pidfile /var/run/redis/redis_6379.pid
loglevel notice
syslog-enabled yes
syslog-ident redis
syslog-facility daemon
databases 16
always-show-logo no
set-proc-title yes
proc-title-template "{title} {listen-addr} {server-mode}"
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes
rdbcompression yes
rdbchecksum yes
dbfilename dump.rdb
rdb-del-sync-files no
dir /var/redis
replica-serve-stale-data yes
replica-read-only yes
repl-diskless-sync no
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
repl-diskless-load disabled
replica-priority 100
acllog-max-len 128
maxclients 96
maxmemory-policy noeviction
maxmemory 64mb
```

### b. Enable Redis
Once you have setup the redis.conf file, enable redis so that it can be run directly on OpenBSD.

```
ns2# rcctl enable redis
ns2# rcctl restart redis
```
To ensure that redis has been installed correctly, check whether the redis port is open or not.

```
ns2# ps -aux |grep redis
_redis   55721  0.0  0.2 15908  3132 ??  S       4:19PM    0:00.05 redis-server: /usr/local/bin/redis-server 127.0.0.1:6379 (redis-server)
root     83550  0.0  0.0   108   324 p0  R+/0    4:19PM    0:00.00 grep redis
```
From the display above, it is certain that Redis is active, because the port 127.0.0.1:6379 is open as we can see above.

## C. How to Run Redis on OpenBSD
This process is to run redis, so that it can be used as you wish. To run the Redis server you must use the redis-cli command.

### a. Connect to Redis server
Run the command below so you can connect to the redis server.

```
ns2# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

### b. Login to the redis server
Even though you have connected to the redis server, you cannot use redis yet. In order for redis to be used, we must enter the password that we have created in the **/etc/redis/redis.conf** file above. In the file above, we have specified the password "router123". Use this password to log in to the redis server.

```
127.0.0.1:6379> auth router123
OK
```

### c. Create a user
Once you have successfully logged into the redis server, you can do anything with redis. We will show you how to create a user in redis.

```
127.0.0.1:6379> set name maryrose
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get name
"maryrose"
```
So far, a high availability RedisCache Service has been built, you can connect redis with various other applications such as Wordpress, Nexcloud, Gatsby and others.
