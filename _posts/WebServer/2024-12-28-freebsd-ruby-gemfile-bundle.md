For beginner programmers, perhaps many are still not familiar with Ruby because it is rarely used as a basis. Ruby is one of the superior programming languages for developing website applications. The Ruby programming language was designed with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Its intuitive and English-like syntax makes it easy to understand and use, especially for programming beginners.

One of Ruby's advantages is that it has a web development framework known as Ruby on Rails or often abbreviated as Rails. Before Rails, developers often spent a lot of time writing code over and over again. However, with Rails, this process is faster because Rails has the CoC (Convention over Configuration) principle and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

CoC is an approach where the system provides built-in conventions to simplify common tasks, reducing the need for developers to configure every detail. While DRY encourages reducing duplication in code. This principle emphasizes the importance of keeping information or logic in one single place in the code, ensuring the code is more maintainable and minimizing errors.

On FreeBSD, managing and running a Ruby application usually involves determining the Ruby version and dependencies that will form the library to reference our project. Ruby has lots of dependencies, and you have to install all of them according to the project you are working on. Look at the image below.

> Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented programming language. Ruby was designed with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

In this article, we will learn about the Ruby installation process and file library dependencies for Ruby. To complete the contents of this article, we will also explain the process of creating a Ruby PATH. We have implemented the entire contents of this article on the FreeBSD 13.3 server, and you can also apply it to FreeBSD 14.<br><br/>
## 1. Install Ruby From ports and PKG
There are two ways to install applications on FreeBSD, namely the ports system and the PKG package. In this article, we will use both methods. Before you start installing Ruby, update and install Ruby dependencies. Follow the method below.

**Update PKG**
```
root@ns3:~ # pkg update -f
root@ns3:~ # pkg upgrade -f
```
**Update Ports**
```
root@ns3:~ # portmaster -a
root@ns3:~ # portupgrade -a
```

After that, we continue by installing the dependencies.

```
root@ns3:~ # pkg install libffi autoconf automake libyaml libedit libunwind rubygem-atk rubygem-fpm rubygem-minitar-cli puppetdb-terminus7 puppetdb-terminus8 rubygem-activemodel61
```

Once you have finished installing dependencies, continue with installing Ruby.

**Install Ruby with PKG**
```
root@ns3:~ #  pkg install ruby32
```
**Install Ruby with Ports**
```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/lang/ruby32
root@ns3:/usr/ports/lang/ruby32 # make install clean
```

By default the Ruby binary file is "ruby32". Change the file to "ruby" by creating a symlink.

>**Create Symlink**
>
>root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/bin
>
>root@ns3:/usr/local/bin # ln -s ruby32 /usr/local/bin/ruby

Check the Ruby version.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/bin # ruby --version
ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [amd64-freebsd13]
```

## 2. Create PATH Environment Variable
By default, FreeBSD stores Ruby files (lib and bin) in the /usr/local/lib/ruby directory. To make it easier for you to manage Ruby files that will be used for work projects, we can change $PATH $HOME as desired.

In this article we will create $PATH $HOME for Ruby, Gem and Bundler. The method is very easy, you just need to add the script to .cshrc and csh.cshrc.

### a. Create a $PATH directory
Before we start creating the $PATH environment variable for Ruby, first create a directory to place the $PATH file. Follow the instructions below.

```
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/ruby
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/ruby/gems
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/ruby/gems/lib
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/ruby/bundle
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/ruby/bundle/lib
```

### b. $PATH $HOME Ruby
To create a Path environment in a Ruby file, open the csh.cshrc file and add the script below.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee /etc/csh.cshrc
setenv RUBY_VERSION "3.2+"
setenv RUBY_HOME /usr/local/ruby
```

Also open the .cshrc file, and type the script below in the file.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee .cshrc
set path = ($RUBY_HOME/bin /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin)
```

### c. $PATH $HOME GEM
The way to create $PATH $HOME for GEM is almost the same as Ruby. So that it doesn't get messy, we will place the working directory with the Ruby working directory. Follow the steps below to create a $PATH $HOME GEM.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee /etc/csh.cshrc
setenv GEM_HOME /usr/local/ruby/gems
setenv GEM_PATH /usr/local/ruby/gems/lib
```

Then in the /root/.cshrc file, type the script below.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee .cshrc
set path = ($GEM_HOME/bin /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin)
set path = ($GEM_PATH/bin /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin)
```

### d. $PATH $HOME Bundler
In this section, we will create a $PATH $HOME Bundler. Not much different from above, open the file /etc/csh.cshrc, and type the script below.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee /etc/csh.cshrc
setenv BUNDLE_HOME /usr/local/ruby/bundle
setenv BUNDLE_PATH /usr/local/ruby/bundle/lib
```

Then in the /root/.bashrc file, you add the script below.

```
root@ns3:~ # ee .cshrc
set path = ($BUNDLE_HOME/bin /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin)
set path = ($BUNDLE_PATH/bin /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin)
```

## 3. Install GEMS
Installing Ruby gems is an important skill for developers to have. Ruby gems are an essential tool in the website development toolkit, you can simplify the process of expanding Ruby's capabilities. Installing it correctly is essential for efficient and error-free coding.

RubyGems is a Ruby utility system created to simplify, facilitate the creation, sharing, and installation of libraries. On Linux systems RubyGems is almost identical to the apt-get distribution packaging system targeted at Ruby software. RubyGems is the de-facto method for sharing gems.

In this section, we will learn the process of installing RubyGems and how to use it on FreeBSD. Run the following command to install RubyGems.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/devel/ruby-gems
root@ns3:/usr/ports/devel/ruby-gems # make install clean
```

### a. Update Gems
Before you start a new project, perform the update gem command to its latest version to get the latest features and fixes. Usually professional developers, use several tricks to optimize the Ruby development environment and keep it up to date.

**Check the Gems version**
```
root@ns3:~ # gem -v
3.4.20
```
**Update Gems**
```
root@ns3:~ # gem update --system
```

### b. Install App with gems
A gem is a collection of related code used to solve a specific problem. Gems can be used to install Ruby Apps. Take a look at the example below to install an App with Gem.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem install httparty
When you HTTParty, you must party hard!
Successfully installed httparty-0.21.0
Parsing documentation for httparty-0.21.0
Done installing documentation for httparty after 1 seconds
1 gem installed
```

For installing Multiple Gems, you can also install multiple gems at once by listing them all in a single gem install command.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem install rails puma nokogiri
```

You can run the update command, to update the App.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem update httparty
root@ns3:~ # gem update rails puma nokogiri
```

### c. List installed gems
You can see a list of all gems installed with Ruby.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem list
```

Run the following command, to check if the installed gems are outdated.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem outdated
```

### d. Uninstalling Gems
To remove installed gems, run the uninstall gems command.

```
root@ns3:~ # gem uninstall httparty
Remove executables:
        httparty

in addition to the gem? [Yn]  y
Removing httparty
Successfully uninstalled httparty-0.21.0
```

## 4. Install Bundler
Bundler is a Ruby utility for creating a consistent application environment for your applications, so you can specify the library version for the project you are working on. Bundler provides a consistent environment for your Ruby projects.

Bundler can track and install the right gems and versions for the project you are working on. Bundler can also prevent dependencies and ensure that the gems you need are in development, staging, and production. Run the following command to install the bundler on the FreeBSD server.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/sysutils/rubygem-bundler
root@ns3:/usr/ports/sysutils/rubygem-bundler # make install clean
```

In this article, we will explain how to use Bundler on FreeBSD. For example, we create a new working directory, after that create a Gemfile file. Follow the guide below.

```
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # touch Gemfile
```

After that, in the Gemfile file, type the script below.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # ee Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails'
gem 'httparty'

gem 'fui', '~> 0.3.0'
gem 'nokogiri'
gem 'second_curtain', '~> 0.2.3'
gem 'puma'
```

After creating a Gemfile, run bundle install to install or bundle update to update within the constraints of your Gemfile.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # bundle install
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # bundle update
```

Run the bundle outdated command. to list the gems in your project that have a newer version.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # bundle outdated
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
Resolving dependencies...

Gem             Current  Latest  Requested  Groups
fui             0.3.0    0.5.0   ~> 0.3.0   default
json            1.8.6    2.7.1
mustache        0.99.8   1.1.1
second_curtain  0.2.4    0.6.0   ~> 0.2.3   default
```

To verify installed gems, you can run the gem list command.

**Check gems list**
```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # gem list
```

## 5. Install rbenv
rbenv is a utility for the Ruby programming language on Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD. rbenv is very useful for switching between multiple Ruby versions on the same machine. Additionally, rbenv is also useful for ensuring that every project you work on is always running on the correct version of Ruby.

To install rbenv on FreeBSD is very easy, you just run the install command, as in the example below.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/devel/rbenv
root@ns3:/usr/ports/devel/rbenv # make install clean
```

After that, you check the version of rbenv used on FreeBSD.

**Check version rbenv**
```
root@ns3:~ # rbenv --version
rbenv 1.2.0
```

You can create rbenv project by running the following command.

**Create rbenv project**
```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/FreeBSD_Gem # rbenv init
```

Gems, rbenv and Bundler are important tools for managing your Ruby application dependencies. Gems, rbenv and Bundler can help you manage your app's gem dependencies, ensuring your app runs smoothly and avoiding conflicts between different gem versions. By understanding how Gems and Bundler work, you can make Ruby applications more powerful, easy to manage, and fun to use.
