Laravel is one of the most popular web application frameworks for the PHP programming language. It has an expressive and elegant syntax and its development has been an amazing experience. With Laravel, developers can easily build websites quickly and efficiently.

Meanwhile, PyroCMS is built with Laravel and feels like an extension and makes it easy to build better websites and applications quickly. PyroCMS is not only a content management system but also a powerful and modern engine and platform development.

This Content Management System (CMS) is often used by bloggers from beginners to professionals. PyroCMS uses a popular framework so it is easy to understand.

PyroCMS is an open-source object-oriented content management system application built using PHP and Laravel. PyroCMS is easy to use, looks great, and uses some smart caching to keep everything running smoothly. PyroCMS can be easily built with Modules, Widgets, and Plugins that are easy to create and can be customized with Themes.

According to the official PyroCMS website, here are the main features of this CMS.
- Made with PHP language which has proven its quality.
- OPEN SOURCE application.
- Has a very simple Control panel display that is based on standard patterns and principles such as API.
- Responsive Control Panel with easy content management.
- Multilingual support.
- Rapid development.


## 1. System requirements
To run PyroCMS on FreeBSD, you need to meet several conditions.
- OS: FreeBSD 13.2.
- Apache version: Apache24.
- PHP-FPM.
- PHP version: PHP82.
- mod PHP82, PHP82 extension, php82-xmlwriter, php82-xmlreader, php82-fileinfo.
- mysql80-server.

## 2. Enabling mod_PHP on Apache
Since PyroCMS is built with PHP, as the main topic in this article we will enable mod_PHP on Apache24 web server.

Use the following command to start enabling mod_PHP.
```console
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/lang/php82
root@ns3:/usr/ports/lang/php82 # make install clean
root@ns3:/usr/ports/lang/php82 # cd /usr/ports/www/mod_php82
root@ns3:/usr/ports/www/mod_php82 # make install clean
root@ns3:/usr/ports/www/mod_php82 # cd /usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli
root@ns3:/usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli # make install clean
```
```console
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-xmlwriter
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-xmlreader
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-fileinfo
```
After that, type the following script into the file `"/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf"`.

```html
LoadModule php_module         libexec/apache24/libphp.so

<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
</IfModule>

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
```

Proceed by creating a php.ini file, just copy it from the existing one.
```console
root@ns3:/usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli # cp /usr/local/etc/php.ini-production /usr/local/etc/php.ini
```
Then you activate the following script.

```
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
```

In this article we will enable PHP-FPM, with the aim of making the process of reading PHP files faster. We will not discuss the PHP-FPM installation process. You can read the previous article.

Restart PHP-FPM and Apache24, so that all PHP modules can be read by Apache.
```console
root@ns3:~ # service apache24 restart
root@ns3:~ # service php-fpm restart
```

## 3. How to Install PHP Composer
Before we install PHP composer, first enable SSL mod in "/usr/local/etc/php.ini" file. Use the command below to create SSL mod.
```console
root@ns3:~ # cd /etc/ssl
root@ns3:/etc/ssl # wget http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
```
Enter the SSL file that we created above into the file `"/usr/local/etc/php.ini"`.

```
openssl.cafile=/etc/ssl/cacert.pem
```

On FreeBSD, PHP composer can be installed in two ways, namely through the PKG package and curl. For convenience, we simply use Curl.
```console
root@ns3:/etc/ssl # cd /tmp
root@ns3:/tmp # curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
root@ns3:/tmp # php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```
Check the Composer version.
```console
root@ns3:/tmp # composer --version
Composer version 2.6.6 2023-12-08 18:32:26
```

## 4. Creating a MySQL Database
In order for PyroCMS to run perfectly, a database is needed to support it. Okay, now let's move on to creating a database for PyroCMS. Since the one running on our FreeBSD server is a MySQL server, we use the MySQL server as the database.
```console
root@ns3:/tmp # mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 12
Server version: 8.0.35 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

root@localhost [(none)]>
```
**Create a database:**
- database name: `pyrocma`
- username: `userpyrocms`
- Password: `router123`

```console
root@localhost [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE pyrocms CHARACTER SET utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.13 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> CREATE USER 'userpyrocms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'router123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pyrocms.* TO 'userpyrocms'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

## 5. How to Install PyroCMS
The last installation we have to do is PyroCMS. Because in this article we will use Apache24, then place the PyroCMS folder in `"/usr/local/www"`.

```console
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/www root@ns3:/usr/local/www # git clone https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms.git
```

Update Composer.

```console
root@ns3:/usr/local/www # cd pyrocms
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # composer update
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # composer install
```
Use the following command to install PyroCMS.
```console
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # php artisan install

Run the chown and chmod commands, for ownership and access rights to the files.
```console
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # chown -R www:www /usr/local/www/pyrocms/
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # chmod -R 775 /usr/local/www/pyrocms/
```
The final configuration is to type the following command in the file `"/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf"`.

```html
Alias /pyrocms "/usr/local/www/pyrocms/"
<Directory "/usr/local/www/pyrocms">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Restart PHP-FPM and Apache24.
```console
root@ns3:~ # service apache24 restart
root@ns3:~ # service php-fpm restart
```

## 6. Run PyroCMS Test
At this stage, we will test PyroCMS. Is there anything wrong with the configuration you did above?.

Open Google Chrome web browser, type `"http://192.168.5.2/pyrocms/"`.

![test pyrocms](https://gitflic.ru/project/unixbsdshell/ruby-static-page-jekyll-rb-openbsd/blob/raw?file=assets/images/10Test%20PyroCMS.jpg&commit=e8ebb8577f6fe1607118d88c7adabf5029e94c8b)

and `"http://192.168.5.2/pyrocms/public/"`.
