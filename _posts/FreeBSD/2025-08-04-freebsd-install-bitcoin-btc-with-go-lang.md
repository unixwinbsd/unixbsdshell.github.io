btcd is an alternative full-node Bitcoin implementation written in the Go programming language (Go Lang). The btcd project is under active development and is in Beta status. Its stability is comparable to Bitcoin Core, and it has been in production use since October 2013.

When you use Bitcoin Core or any other Bitcoin protocol implementation, you trust the software to implement the protocol correctly and handle all operations correctly. One of the most impressive advantages of the Bitcoin network is that it can protect itself from malicious or misbehaving nodes.

The first full-node client implementation, and one that remains popular today, is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is the original client released by Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin project is open-source and actively maintained by the Bitcoin community. Installable binaries are available on bitcoin.org for any platform of choice.

Besides Bitcoin Core, another well-known client is BTCD by Conformal Systems. BTCD implements most of the core node functionality except for the wallet and on-chain functionality. The team instead separated the wallet functionality into a separate wallet application called btcwallet. The btcd client application also has slight differences from Bitcoin Core, such as enabling TLS for RPC connections by default and accepting HTTP and Websocket requests.

BTC Wallet is a hierarchical deterministic (HD) Bitcoin wallet client for a single user. The application acts as an RPC client for btcd and an RPC server for wallet clients and legacy RPC applications. btcWAllet uses HD paths for BIP0044 address derivation and encrypts private keys and public data.

BTCD can correctly download, validate, and serve blockchains using the same block acceptance rules as Bitcoin Core. In working on this project, the development team took great care to prevent BTCD from causing a fork in the blockchain. This work includes a comprehensive block validation testing framework containing all the 'official' block acceptance tests (and several additional tests) that are run on every withdrawal request to help ensure it follows consensus correctly. Furthermore, BTCD can pass all JSON test data within the Bitcoin Core code.

BTCD's advantages extend beyond this: BTCD clients can correctly submit newly mined blocks, maintain transaction pools, and submit individual transactions that have not yet been included in blocks. This ensures that all individual transactions accepted into the pool follow the blockchain's required rules and also includes stricter vetting by filtering transactions based on miner requirements.


## 1. Btcd Installation Process
One fundamental difference between BTCD and Bitcoin Core is that BTCD does not include a wallet function, a decision made by the BTCD developers to differentiate between Bitcoin Core and BTCD. Without a wallet function, you cannot make or receive payments directly with BTCD. This functionality is provided by the BTCWallet and Paymetheus projects (for Windows only), both of which are still in active development.

Since Btcd is written in Go, the primary requirement for installing it is that Go must be installed on the FreeBSD server. You can read our previous article on [the Go installation process on FreeBSD](https://unixwinbsd.site/freebsd/go-lang-freebsd14-golang-install/).

For those of you familiar with installing Bitcoin Core or other cryptocurrencies, installing Btcd will be very easy. Despite its many feature abstractions, the configuration process is nearly identical to Bitcoin Core. Btcd also has an RPC interface compatible with Bitcoin Core. Aside from the wallet and blockchain features, everything else is nearly identical to Bitcoin Core.

FreeBSD doesn't provide a PKG package or porting system for Btcd; you'll need to download it from the official Btcd repository on GitHub. Follow the instructions below to get started configuring Btcd.
```
root@ns7:~ # cd /usr/local/etc
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc # git clone https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd.git
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc # cd btcd
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd #
```
Run the following commands to update btcd, all dependencies, and install it on FreeBSD.
```
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # mkdir -p bin
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # git pull

Already up to date.
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # go install -v . ./cmd/...
```
The install command above will create an executable bin file. On FreeBSD, the location of the Btcd bin file is `/root/go/bin`. It's up to you whether you want to move the bin file or not. We recommend moving it to the Btcd folder.
```
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # mv /root/go/bin/* /usr/local/etc/btcd/bin
```

## 2. Btcd Configuration Process

Since Btcd and Bitcoin Core are in the same family, the configuration methods are almost identical. On FreeBSD, the location of the Btcd data file is **/root/.btcd**. Copy the file **/usr/local/etc/btcd/sample-btcd.conf** to the **/root/.btcd** folder. Use the following commands to copy it.

```
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # mkdir -p /root/.btcd
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # mkdir -p /root/.btcd/data
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # cp /usr/local/etc/btcd/sample-btcd.conf /root/.btcd/btcd.conf
```
The above command creates the .btcd folder and copies and renames the `sample-btcd.conf`file to btcd.conf.

To better understand how to configure Btcd, run the btcd -help command to see where we'll place our configuration options.

```
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd # cd bin
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/btcd/bin # ./btcd -h

You can now edit the btcd.conf file. Adjust the configuration to suit your computer's hardware and FreeBSD server specifications.

Once everything is configured, run Btcd with the command `"./btcd"`.

The synchronization process can take 3-4 days, depending on your internet connection and machine specifications. However, you can start testing blockchain data while the synchronization is in progress. Use the Bitcoin testnet by adding the --testnet flag to btcd. This way, you can easily test transactions with the testnet coins.
