Redis is often referred to as a data structure server. This means it provides access to mutable data structures through a series of commands, sent using a client-server model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. This allows multiple processes to request and modify the same data structures in the same way.


Redis can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD. Redis' caching method is used in Gatsby and client sites like WordPress, Nextcloud, and others. As an in-memory cache, it handles traffic spikes very well.

## A. What is Redis Cache?
Caching is crucial for ensuring a fast and smooth user experience in the digital world by storing frequently used data in fast-access storage. Caching minimizes data retrieval times and reduces backend load, allowing web applications to scale and efficiently handle high traffic volumes. Essentially, caching contributes to the responsiveness and scalability of web platforms.

[Redis](https://www.liquidweb.com/blog/redis-as-cache/#:~:text=Redis%2C%20while%20capable%20of%20functioning,the%20performance%20of%20your%20website.) is one of the most popular key-value databases, ranking 4th in user satisfaction for NoSQL databases. Its popularity continues to grow, and many companies are seeking Redis developers for roles such as database administrators and more. Redis is a popular, fast, open-source in-memory data store used as a database, cache, and intermediary between site visitors and site administrators.

At its core, Redis operates by storing data in key-value pairs, making data retrieval extremely fast and efficient. When used as a cache, Redis temporarily stores frequently accessed data that would otherwise be expensive to retrieve or compute repeatedly. Here's how it works:

- **Data Retrieval:** When an application requests data, it first checks the Redis cache.
- **Success or Failure:** If the requested data is found in the cache (cache hit), Redis returns the data immediately, significantly reducing latency. If the data is not in the cache (cache miss), the application retrieves the data from the primary database.
- **Data Storage:** After retrieving data, it is stored in the Redis cache, allowing subsequent requests for the same data to be served more quickly.

Redis client-side caching is also known as "tracking." Because Redis is a data structure-based solution, it can be cached using strings, hashes, lists, sets, or sorted sets. This cache uses streams and many other data structures, and you should also know that reading and writing to the cache requires the use of the GET and SET commands in Redis.

## B. How to Install Redis on OpenBSD
You can install Redis on OpenBSD using the ports system or the available PKG package. OpenBSD users generally prefer installing packages using the PKG. You can follow each of the commands below to install Redis.

```
ns2# pkg_add pecl82-redis
ns2# pkg_add redis
```

### a. Redis Configuration

The main Redis configuration file is located in `"/etc/redis"` which consists of the following files:
- redis.conf, and
- sentinel.conf.

You can modify the script in the `redis.conf` file to suit your needs and the specifications of your OpenBSD system. Below is an example of the `"/etc/redis/redis/redis.conf"` file, which we have adapted to the needs and OpenBSD system we are currently using.

```
bind 127.0.0.1 -::1
protected-mode yes
port 6379
daemonize yes
requirepass puncakanjani
tcp-backlog 511
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
unixsocketperm 770
timeout 0
tcp-keepalive 300
pidfile /var/run/redis/redis_6379.pid
loglevel notice
syslog-enabled yes
syslog-ident redis
syslog-facility daemon
databases 16
always-show-logo no
set-proc-title yes
proc-title-template "{title} {listen-addr} {server-mode}"
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes
rdbcompression yes
rdbchecksum yes
dbfilename dump.rdb
rdb-del-sync-files no
dir /var/redis
replica-serve-stale-data yes
replica-read-only yes
repl-diskless-sync no
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
repl-diskless-load disabled
replica-priority 100
acllog-max-len 128
maxclients 96
maxmemory-policy noeviction
maxmemory 64mb
```

### b. Activate Redis

After you've configured the `redis.conf` file, activate Redis so it can run directly on OpenBSD.

```
ns2# rcctl enable redis
ns2# rcctl restart redis
```

To ensure that redis has been installed correctly, check whether the redis port is open or not.

```
ns2# ps -aux |grep redis
_redis   55721  0.0  0.2 15908  3132 ??  S       4:19PM    0:00.05 redis-server: /usr/local/bin/redis-server 127.0.0.1:6379 (redis-server)
root     83550  0.0  0.0   108   324 p0  R+/0    4:19PM    0:00.00 grep redis
```

From the display above, it can be confirmed that Redis is active, because the port `127.0.0.1:6379` is open as we can see above.

## C. How to Run Redis on OpenBSD

This process is to run Redis so it can be used as desired. To run the Redis server, you must use the `redis-cli` command.

### a. Connect to the Redis server

Run the command below to connect to the Redis server.

```
ns2# redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

### b. Login to the Redis server

Even though you've connected to the Redis server, you can't use Redis yet. To use Redis, we must enter the password we created in the `/etc/redis/redis.conf` file above. In the file above, we've specified the password "puncakanjani". Use this password to log in to the Redis server.


```
127.0.0.1:6379> auth puncakanjani
OK
```

### c. Creating a New User

Once you've successfully logged in to the Redis server, you can do anything with Redis. We'll show you how to create a user in Redis.


```
127.0.0.1:6379> set name udinsedunia
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get name
"udinsedunia"
```

So far, RedisCache Service with high availability has been built, you can connect redis with various other applications such as Wordpress, Nexcloud, Gatsby and others.
