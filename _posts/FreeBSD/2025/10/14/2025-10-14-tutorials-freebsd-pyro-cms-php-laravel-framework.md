Laravel is one of the most popular web application frameworks for the PHP programming language. It boasts an expressive and elegant syntax, making development a seamless experience. With Laravel, developers can easily build websites quickly and efficiently.

Meanwhile, PyroCMS, built with Laravel, feels like an extension, making it easy to build better websites and applications quickly. PyroCMS is not only a content management system but also a powerful and modern development engine and platform.

This Content Management System (CMS) is often used by bloggers from beginners to professionals. PyroCMS uses a popular framework, making it easy to understand.

PyroCMS is an open-source object-oriented content management system application built using PHP and Laravel. PyroCMS is easy to use, looks great, and uses some intelligent caching to keep everything running smoothly. PyroCMS is easily extendable with Modules, Widgets, and Plugins that are easy to create and can be customized with Themes.

According to the official PyroCMS website, here are the main features of this CMS.

- Built with the proven PHP language.
- Open Source application.
- A very simple control panel interface built on standard patterns and principles, such as APIs.
- Responsive control panel with easy content management.
- Multilingual support.
- Rapid development.


## 1. System requirements

To run PyroCMS on FreeBSD, you need to meet several conditions.

- OS: FreeBSD 13.2.
- Apache version: Apache24.
- PHP-FPM.
- PHP version: PHP82.
- mod PHP82 dan PHP82 extension.
- php82-xmlwriter, php82-xmlreader, php82-fileinfo.
- mysql80-server.


## 2. Enable mod_PHP in Apache

Since PyroCMS is built in PHP, the main topic of this article will be enabling mod_PHP on the Apache24 web server.

Use the following command to enable mod_PHP.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/lang/php82
root@ns3:/usr/ports/lang/php82 # make install clean
root@ns3:/usr/ports/lang/php82 # cd /usr/ports/www/mod_php82
root@ns3:/usr/ports/www/mod_php82 # make install clean
root@ns3:/usr/ports/www/mod_php82 # cd /usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli
root@ns3:/usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli # make install clean
```

<br/>

```
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-xmlwriter
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-xmlreader
root@ns3:~ # pkg install php82-fileinfo
```

After that, type the following script into the file `"/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf"`.

```
LoadModule php_module         libexec/apache24/libphp.so

<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
</IfModule>

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
```

Proceed by creating a php.ini file, just copy it from the existing one.

```
root@ns3:/usr/ports/databases/php82-mysqli # cp /usr/local/etc/php.ini-production /usr/local/etc/php.ini
```

Then you activate the following script.

```
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
```

In this article, we'll enable PHP-FPM to speed up PHP file reading. We won't cover the PHP-FPM installation process. You can read the previous article.. [Configuring PHP FPM and Apache24 on FreeBSD](https://unixwinbsd.site/freebsd/setup-php-fpm-apache-freebsd/)

Restart PHP-FPM and Apache24, so that all PHP modules can be read by Apache.

```
root@ns3:~ # service apache24 restart
root@ns3:~ # service php-fpm restart
```

## 3. How to Install PHP Composer

Before we install PHP Composer, first enable the SSL mod in the `"/usr/local/etc/php.ini"` file. Use the command below to create the SSL mod.

```
root@ns3:~ # cd /etc/ssl
root@ns3:/etc/ssl # wget http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
```

Enter the SSL file that we created above into the file `"/usr/local/etc/php.ini"`.

```
openssl.cafile=/etc/ssl/cacert.pem
```

On FreeBSD, PHP Composer can be installed in two ways: via the PKG package and via curl.

For simplicity, we can simply use curl.


```
root@ns3:/etc/ssl # cd /tmp
root@ns3:/tmp # curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
root@ns3:/tmp # php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

Check the Composer version.

```
root@ns3:/tmp # composer --version
Composer version 2.6.6 2023-12-08 18:32:26
```

## 4. Creating a MySQL Database
For PyroCMS to run properly, it needs a database to support it. Okay, now let's move on to creating a database for PyroCMS. Since our FreeBSD server is running MySQL, we'll use MySQL as the database.


```
root@ns3:/tmp # mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 12
Server version: 8.0.35 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

root@localhost [(none)]>
```

**Creating a database:**
- Database name: **pyrocma**
- Username: **userpyrocms**
- Password: **router123**


```
root@localhost [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE pyrocms CHARACTER SET utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.13 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> CREATE USER 'userpyrocms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'router123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pyrocms.* TO 'userpyrocms'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

root@localhost [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

## 5. How to Install PyroCMS

The final installation we need to do is PyroCMS. Since we'll be using Apache24 in this article, place the PyroCMS folder in `/usr/local/www`.


```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/www
root@ns3:/usr/local/www # git clone https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms.git
```

Update Composer.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www # cd pyrocms
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # composer update
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # composer install
```

Use the following command to install PyroCMS.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # php artisan install

Run the chown and chmod commands, for ownership and access rights to files.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # chown -R www:www /usr/local/www/pyrocms/
root@ns3:/usr/local/www/pyrocms # chmod -R 775 /usr/local/www/pyrocms/
```

The final configuration is to type the following command in the file `"/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf"`.

```
Alias /pyrocms "/usr/local/www/pyrocms/"
<Directory "/usr/local/www/pyrocms">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted

```

Restart PHP-FPM and Apache24.


```
root@ns3:~ # service apache24 restart
root@ns3:~ # service php-fpm restart
```

## 6. Run PyroCMS Test
