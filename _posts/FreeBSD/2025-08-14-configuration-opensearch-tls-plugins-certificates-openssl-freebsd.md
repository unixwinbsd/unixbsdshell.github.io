OpenSearch is an open-source utility widely used as a search engine and also as a powerful tool for data analysis. OpenSearch is based on the Elasticsearch 7.10.2 codebase. The OpenSearch system includes:

- Storage and search engine.
- Web interface.
- OpenSearch Dashboard data visualization environment.
- Add-ons that allow you to use some of the Elasticsearch engine's features.

OpenSearch was born out of community participation and support from major companies like Red Hat, SAP, Capital One, and others. The OpenSearch system is often used for full-text web search because it can store and analyze logs, as well as visualize and analyze the information received.

OpenSearch can be combined with Beat's data delivery platforms (Filebeat, Winlogbeat, etc.), allowing OpenSearch users to build a full log management cycle, including collection, organization, and search.

## B. Setting up Transport layer TLS
In this section, we'll explain how to configure the Opensearch security plugin on FreeBSD. Opensearch offers many plugins you can use, all of which require an SSL certificate to support many additional features and configuration methods. You can configure a TLS certificate using tools like OpenSSL.

Adding a TLS certificate provides additional security for your Opensearch host. The TLS certificate allows clients to verify the node's identity and encrypt traffic between the client and the host. The TLS certificate is configured in the opensearch.yml file, which we'll store in the `/usr/local/etc/opensearch` directory. Follow the steps below to create a `self-signed certificate`.


```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/opensearch
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # rm -f *pem
```

### a. Generate root certificate
Before we go any further, let's first create a private key for the `root` certificate. The root certificate is used to sign other certificates.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl genrsa -out root-ca-key.pem 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus (2 primes)
.........................................+++++
.............................+++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
```
After that, you create your own self-signed `root CA certificate`. Use the -subj parameter to provide your host-specific information.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key root-ca-key.pem -out root-ca.pem -days 730
```

### b. Generate Administrator Certificate
Next, create a certificate for the administrator. To create an `administrator certificate`, first generate a new key so the administrator can perform administrative tasks related to the security plugin.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl genrsa -out admin-key-temp.pem 2048
```

To make the administrator certificate usable with Java programs, convert the key to `PKCS` format.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl pkcs8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in admin-key-temp.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES -out admin-key.pem
```

Next, create a `certificate signing request (CSR)` for the administrator certificate (Certificate Signing Request) based on the private key. This file acts as an application to the CA for the certificate you just signed.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl req -new -key admin-key.pem -out admin.csr
```

Now that the private key and signing request have been created, sign the `administrator certificate` using the root certificate and private key you created earlier.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA root-ca.pem -CAkey root-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -sha256 -out admin.pem -days 730
```

### c. Create Node Certificate
Creating a node certificate is almost the same as the steps for creating an administrator certificate above. In this section, we'll create a key and CSR with a new file name for each node and client certificate. To create a node or client certificate, first create a new key.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl genrsa -out node1-key-temp.pem 2048
```

Then convert the private key to `PKCS format`, so that it can be used by Java applications.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl pkcs8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in node1-key-temp.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES -out node1-key.pem
```

Next, create a new `CSR` for the host certificate based on the private key.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl req -new -key node1-key.pem -out node1.csr
```

For all host and client certificates, you must specify `a subject alternative name (SAN)`.
Before creating a signed certificate, create a SAN extension file containing the hostname and domain name.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # echo 'subjectAltName=DNS:node1.datainchi.com' > node1.ext
```
Next, create the certificate.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl x509 -req -in node1.csr -CA root-ca.pem -CAkey root-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -sha256 -out node1.pem -days 730 -extfile node1.ext
```
Next, convert the CA root certificate to .crt format so that the `CA` root certificate can be installed on the Opensearch server.


```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # openssl x509 -outform der -in root-ca.pem -out root-ca.crt
```
Change the ownership and permissions of the directory to `opensearch:opensearch`.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # chown -R opensearch:opensearch /usr/local/etc/opensearch/
```

### d. Preparing Certificates for Opensearch
Once you've created all the certificates, proceed to install them and add them to your OpenSearch configuration file,  `"opensearch.yml"` Open `"/usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml"` and at the very bottom of the script (the end of the script), add the following script.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/etc/opensearch # ee opensearch.yml
plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemcert_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/node1.pem
plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemkey_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/node1-key.pem
plugins.security.ssl.transport.pemtrustedcas_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/root-ca.pem
plugins.security.ssl.http.enabled: true
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemcert_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/node1.pem
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemkey_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/node1-key.pem
plugins.security.ssl.http.pemtrustedcas_filepath: /usr/local/etc/opensearch/root-ca.pem
plugins.security.allow_default_init_securityindex: true
plugins.security.authcz.admin_dn:
  - 'CN=A,OU=UNIT,O=ORG,L=TORONTO,ST=ONTARIO,C=CA'
plugins.security.nodes_dn:
  - 'CN=node1.datainchi.com,OU=UNIT,O=ORG,L=TORONTO,ST=ONTARIO,C=CA'
plugins.security.audit.type: internal_opensearch
plugins.security.enable_snapshot_restore_privilege: true
plugins.security.check_snapshot_restore_write_privileges: true
```

## C. Plugin Installation Process
As we know, Opensearch includes several core plugins as part of its release installation. In Opensearch, plugins are used to enhance core functions and features. In addition to core plugins, you can also write your own custom plugins, and there are also community-created plugins available on GitHub.

For plugins to function properly and connect with Opensearch, all plugins must be able to access data in the cluster. Before using a plugin, you must first understand its function and benefits. Then, you should learn what plugins are available in Opensearch. You can view the available plugins by running the command below.

## D. How to use the Opensearch plugin
Opensearch's functionality and features can be enhanced by adding custom plugins. Examples of plugins that can enhance Opensearch's functionality include adding custom mapping types, engine scripts, and more. In this section, we'll learn how to use Opensearch plugins. Here's a sample script for installing a plugin:

```
/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin/opensearch-plugin install plugin-name
```

To further your understanding of plugins, here's an example of how to install a plugin.


```
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install org.codelibs.opensearch:opensearch-analysis-fess:2.9.0
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install org.codelibs.opensearch:opensearch-analysis-extension:2.9.0
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install org.codelibs.opensearch:opensearch-minhash:2.9.0
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install org.codelibs.opensearch:opensearch-configsync:2.9.0
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install analysis-icu
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin install org.opensearch.plugin:opensearch-anomaly-detection:2.2.0.0
```

## E. How to Delete Plugins
Once you've learned how to install a plugin, you'll probably want to know how to remove it. The script is almost identical to installing a plugin, but here's the syntax for removing a plugin:

```
/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin/opensearch-plugin remove plugin-name
```

Below, we show you how to `remove` a plugin.

```
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin remove org.codelibs.opensearch:opensearch-configsync:2.9.0
root@ns3:/usr/local/lib/opensearch/bin # ./opensearch-plugin remove analysis-icu
```
In this post, we've detailed the process of creating an SSL certificate and how to install and remove the Opensearch plugin. We recommend reading all pages of the Opensearch documentation to gain a deeper understanding and make it easier to use its functions and features.
