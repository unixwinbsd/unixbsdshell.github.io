This article discusses a Maven tutorial that provides basic and advanced concepts of Apache Maven technology. The entire contents of the tutorial are run on the FreeBSD system, but you can apply it to Linux systems such as Ubuntu, Debian and others.

Before we discuss Maven further, it's a good idea to get to know Maven. Since most people run Maven on Linux systems, it is rare to run Maven on FreeBSD. We deliberately present this tutorial for FreeBSD lovers to get to know Maven more closely, so that people don't think that Maven cannot be run on a FreeBSD system.

## 1. What is Maven

Maven is a popular open source development tool developed by the Apache Group, it includes a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). Maven is often used to build, publish, and deploy multiple projects at once for better project management. This tool allows developers to build and document a lifecycle framework.

Maven is written in the Java programming language and is used to build projects written in Scala, C#, Ruby, etc. Based on the Project Object Model (POM), this tool has made the life of Java developers easier while developing reports, checking builds, and testing setup automation.

If you want to use maven in your java project then first thing you have to do is install maven java compiler after installation is complete you can create your first maven project. A Maven repository is a directory of JAR files packed with some metadata. Maven metadata is the POM file associated with the project that each package JAR file has, including the external dependencies that each package JAR has. The Maven repository stores all your project jars, plugins, library jars, other artifacts, and their dependencies are any third party software required by your project. You will find three types of repositories in Maven â€“ local, central, and remote. The local repository stores all Maven dependencies.

The Maven repository is a repository for JAR file dependencies written in a file called POM.XML. The POM.XML file contains Java classes, resources, and other dependencies. There are two types of Maven-like repositories that read pom.xml files. Maven can download dependencies specified in the pom.xml file into a local repository from a central or remote server repository. In the POM.XML file Maven can execute the lifecycle, phases, objectives and plugins defined in the pom.xml file.


## 2. Running Maven On FreeBSD

To run Maven on FreeBSD you must first install the Java OpenJDK application on FreeBSD, you can read the guide in the article below.

[Installing and Configuring Java openjdk17 in FreeBSD 14](https://unixwinbsd.site/freebsd/installing-java-openjdk20-on-freebsd14.1stable)

If you have read the article above and have installed Java on FreeBSD, we continue by installing Maven. Write the command below to install Maven on FreeBSD.

```
root@ns7:~ # pkg install maven-wrapper
```

Maven wrapper is used as a wrapper Script for various Maven installations. After the Maven wrapper script has been installed, we continue with installing Maven.

```
root@ns7:~ # pkg install maven39
```

The final step of this process is to validate whether Java and Maven are working, by checking the versions.

```
root@ns7:~ # java -version
openjdk version "17.0.9" 2023-10-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.9+9-1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.9+9-1, mixed mode, sharing)
```
```
root@ns7:~ # mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.9.6 (bc0240f3c744dd6b6ec2920b3cd08dcc295161ae)
Maven home: /usr/local/share/java/apache-maven-3.9
Java version: 17.0.9, vendor: OpenJDK BSD Porting Team, runtime: /usr/local/openjdk17
Default locale: en, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "freebsd", version: "13.2-release", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

If you see output like this, you know that Maven is available and ready to use. It is important for you to know, the Apache maven file is stored in the `/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d` folder with the file name `"apache-maven-3.9"`.

```
root@ns7:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d # ls
apache-maven-3.9
```

Once we know where the Apache Maven files are, copy all the Maven files to the `/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d` folder.


```
root@ns7:~ # cd /usr/local/share/java/apache-maven-3.9
root@ns7:/usr/local/share/java/apache-maven-3.9 # cp -R . /usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d
```


## 3. Using Maven

Now we will try to create a new project with Maven, we will save all the files from the project in `/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d`.


```
root@ns7:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d # mvn archetype:generate
```

First, the utility displays a list of all available templates and prompts you to select one of them. By default, you are prompted to select `2095`, this is an example project using Maven.

Then, specify the archetype:generate version, just choose the default, namely `8`. In the groupId option, write `com`.  in the artifactId write `com.package` and package write `App`. For other options, just press the ENTER button. Look at the image below.

![oct-25-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unixwinbsd/unixbsdshell.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/oct-25-2.jpg)


All configuration created in Maven will be stored in a file `"/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package/pom.xml"`. You can view its contents, and the program sources are located in the folder `"/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package/src/main/java/App/App.java"`.

Open the `"/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package/pom.xml"` file, and search for the word `"maven-jar-plugin"`. Then we edit the contents of the file, so that it becomes.

```
<plugin>
<artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.0.2</version>
	<configuration>
	<archive>
	<manifest>
	<addClasspath>true</addClasspath>
	<mainClass>App.App</mainClass>
	</manifest>
	</archive>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
```


After that, open the project folder that we created earlier and run it with the command `"mvn compile, mvn package and mvn install"`.


```

```

The three commands above will execute the files in the `"/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package/src"` folder to the `"/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package/target"` folder. Look at the image below.

![oct-25-4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unixwinbsd/unixbsdshell.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/oct-25-4.jpg)


The final step is to test with the `"JAR"` file.

```
root@ns7:/usr/local/etc/maven-wrapper/instances.d/com.package # java -jar target/com.package-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Hello World!
```
