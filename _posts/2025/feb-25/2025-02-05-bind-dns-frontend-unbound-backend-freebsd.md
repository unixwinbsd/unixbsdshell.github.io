An important part of managing server configuration and infrastructure involves maintaining and finding a way to find network interfaces and IP addresses by name website. One way to do this is to set up a Domain Name System (DNS). Use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Determining the domain name on a server will make configuration easier, make maintenance easier and improve application service performance.

Setting up private DNS for your private network is a great way to improve your server management and prevent hacker attacks.<br><br/>

## System Specifications

- OS: FreeBSD 13.2-STABLE
- CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 965 3400 MHz
- IP LAN: 192.168.5.2/24
- Domain: unixexplore.com
- IP Unbound: 192.168.5.2
- Port Unbound: 853
- Unbound Version: 1.17.1
- IP DNS Bind: 192.168.5.2
- Port DNS Bind: 53
- DNS Bind Version: BIND 9.18.14 

 In this tutorial, we will set up a bind and unbound DNS server as your domain and private IP address. To carry out the configuration, we will use public DNS from the cloud and Google for the main forward, while we will use unbound DNS as the frontend of the bind DNS server.

 In addition, it is a good idea to also read and practice the article entitled [UNBOUND CONFIGURATION FOR DNSSEC AND DOT CACHING WITH FREEBSD](https://penaadventure.com/en/freebsd/2025/01/11/unbound-caching-dnssec-freebsd-dot/). Because this article is a continuation of the article you are reading. In the article you see the discussion in point "b" namely "Unbound Server as DNS Caching & DNS Over TLS".

In this case, I will not explain how to set unbound, you can read the previous article entitled [UNBOUND IMPLEMENTATION AS DNS OVER TLS CLIENT & SERVER IN FREEBSD](https://www.inchimediatama.org/2024/11/freebsd-unbound-dns-over-tls-dot.html).

## B. Bind DNS Server Installation and Configuration

The first thing we will discuss is making the DNS Bind server as caching of DNS. On FreeBSD, you can use the pkg command to install it.

```yml
root@router2:~ # pkg install bind918 bind9-devel bind-tools libuv
```

Enter the following script in the rc.conf file.

```yml
root@router2:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
named_enable="YES"
named_program="/usr/local/sbin/named"
named_conf="/usr/local/etc/namedb/named.conf"
#named_chrootdir="/usr/local/etc/namedb"
named_flags="-u -c"
named_uid="bind"
```

Enter the following script in the `resolv.conf` file.

```yml
root@router2:~ # ee /etc/resolv.conf
domain unixexplore.com
nameserver 192.168.5.2
```

Create a bind log file.

```yml
root@router2:~ # mkdir /var/named & mkdir /var/named/log
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/default
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/auth_servers
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/dnssec
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/zone_transfers
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/ddns
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/client_security
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/rate_limiting
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/rpz
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/dnstap
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/queries
root@router2:~ # touch /var/named/log/query-errors
```

Give the Bind program permissions.

```yml
root@router2:~ # chown -R bind:bind /var/named/log
root@router2:~ # chown -R bind:bind /usr/local/etc/namedb/named.conf
root@router2:~ # chown -R bind:bind /usr/local/etc/namedb/*
```

Next, we edit the named.conf file. But before we edit the named.conf file, we have to make sure in the unbound.conf file that port 53 is off. Because in the previous tutorial with the title "CONFIGURATION UNBOUND DNS SERVER CACHING DNSSEC AND DNS OVER TLS WITH FREEBSD" port 53 in the unbound.conf file was open. Now we close port 53 in the unbound.conf file. Why does port 53 have to be turned off in the unbound.conf file, because we will use port 53 in the bind application to listen to the port.

Example of a complete script for the `/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file with port `53` in an inactive or dead state.

```console
root@router2:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf

# DNSCrypt
# To enable, use --enable-dnscrypt to configure before compiling.
# Caveats:
# 1. the keys/certs cannot be produced by Unbound. You can use dnscrypt-wrapper
#   for this: https://github.com/cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper/blob/master/README.md#usage
# 2. dnscrypt channel attaches to an interface. you MUST set interfaces to
#   listen on `dnscrypt-port` with the follo0wing snippet:
# server:
#     interface: 0.0.0.0@443
#     interface: ::0@443
#
# Finally, `dnscrypt` config has its own section.
# dnscrypt:

The `"#"` sign in the black text in the script above is turning off port 53 in the `/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file.

After we have turned off port `53`, now let's continue by editing the named.conf file which is located in the `/usr/local/etc/namedb` folder.

```yml

We restart and test the bind program.

```yml
root@router2:~ # service named restart
root@router2:~ # dig google.com
```

After we tested, it turned out that the bind program was not running, because the bind IP 192.168.5.2 and port 53 could not answer google.com's DNS.

## C. Bind Forwarding
So that the Bind DNS server can RUNNING, we have to create a forward script. In this tutorial we will forward the Bind program to the Unbound server with IP 192.168.5.2 port 853.

To forward we have to edit the named.conf file.

```yml
root@router2:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/namedb/named.conf
```

After the unbound conf file is open, add the following forward script on the file `/usr/local/etc/namedb/named.conf`.

```console
zone "." {
  type forward;
  forward first;
  forwarders {
    192.168.5.2 port 853;    
  };
};
```

We restart and test the bind program.

```yml
root@router2:~ # service named restart
root@router2:~ # dig google.com
```

The answer to google.com's DNS is the BIND Program with IP `192.168.5.2` Port `53`
Now we test the unbound program running on port `853 IP 192.168.5.2`.

```console
root@router2:~ # service unbound restart
root@router2:~ # dig -p 853 google.com @192.168.5.2

; <<>> DiG 9.18.19 <<>> -p 853 google.com @192.168.5.2

```

Pay attention to the script above in red, the answer to the google.com DNS is the unbound program with IP 192.168.5.2 Port 853.

All programs are running, both the BIND and UNBOUND programs, everything is running normally. This means that we have succeeded in making the Unbound program the BACKEND of the BIND program, and making the BIND program the FRONTEND for the CLIENT.

Now our PC, laptop or cellphone can use DNS from BIND, namely with IP `192.168.5.2 port 53`.

Below I will provide the COMPLETE SCRIPT of the named.conf file.

// Example secondary zone config entries.  It can be convenient to become
// a secondary at least for the zone your own domain is in.  Ask
// your network administrator for the IP address of the responsible
// primary name server.
//
// Do not forget to include the reverse lookup zone!
// This is named after the first bytes of the IP address, in reverse
// order, with ".IN-ADDR.ARPA" appended, or ".IP6.ARPA" for IPv6.
//
// Before starting to set up a primary zone, make sure you fully
// understand how DNS and BIND work.  There are sometimes
// non-obvious pitfalls.  Setting up a secondary zone is usually simpler.
//
// NB: Don't blindly enable the examples below. :-)  Use actual names
// and addresses instead.
