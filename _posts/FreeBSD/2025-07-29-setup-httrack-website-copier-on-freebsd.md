Website mirroring is the process of creating a copy of the original website and storing it on a personal computer. Using website mirroring will make it easier to track websites by analyzing all files and directories of cloned websites on your personal computer.

The way website mirroring works is almost the same as a photocopier, namely copying all data according to the original data. Currently there are many website mirroring tools available on the market, both paid and free, one of the famous ones is httrack. Because it is easy to use and can be run on almost all operating systems, many people use httrack to clone websites.

HTTrack is a free and open source website mirroring, httrack allows you to download World Wide Web sites from the Internet to a local directory, build all directories recursively, get HTML, images and other files from the website server and save to your computer. With httrack you can browse the website from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update existing mirror sites, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.

HTTrack is a powerful tool that allows users to create original copies of original websites. Not only that, HTTrack offers various customization options to control the mirroring process. Users can set bandwidth limits, specify the types of directory files to download, configure authentication credentials, and define rules for handling errors.

Httrack is very popular in the Windows environment, but you will be able to experience all of its features if you run it on the FreeBSD operating system. In this article, we will review how to use Httrack on a FreeBSD 13.2 server.

## 1. Install HTTrack

You can install HTTrack on FreeBSD in two ways, namely with the ports system and the PKG package. In this article we will install HTTrack with the PKG package, apart from being simple, the installation process is fast.
```
root@ns3:~ # pkg update
root@ns3:~ # pkg upgrade
```
The command above is used to update the PKG package, after the update process is complete you can continue by installing HTTrack.
```
root@ns3:~ # pkg install www/httrack
```
It's very easy, yes, installing HTTrack on FreeBSD is made very easy. There is no configuration conf file, no rc.d script. On FreeBSD HTTrack is run with the cmd shell menu. Now try checking the HTTrack version.
```
root@ns3:~ # httrack --version
HTTrack version 3.49-4+libhtsjava.so.2
```
To make it easier for you to run HTTrack, a user guide is available. You can run the command "httrack --hel", the options used to run HTTrack will appear.
```
root@ns3:~ # httrack --help
```


## 2. Launch HTTrack

Before proceeding, Creating a directory where we will save the downloaded site mirrors.
```
root@ns3:~ # mkdir -p /var/httrack
root@ns3:~ # cd /var/httrack
root@ns3:/var/httrack #
```
After you have finished creating the HTTrack directory, you can immediately run HTTrack. In the example of this article we will clone a website that comes from Blogspot. In this example we will download all the content on the blogspot "https://www.unixwinbsd.site"
```
root@ns3:/var/httrack # httrack https://www.unixwinbsd.site
```
The length of time for the cloning process depends on how many articles there are on the blog site. The more articles there are on the blog site, the longer the cloning process will take. On the other hand, for the few articles on the blog site, the cloning process only takes a moment.

order to continue downloading a large blog or synchronize the local version with what is available on the Internet, httrack can update the downloaded project. As far as I understand, to do this, you need to add the --update key to the above spell.
```
root@ns3:/var/httrack # httrack --update https://www.unixwinbsd.site
```
