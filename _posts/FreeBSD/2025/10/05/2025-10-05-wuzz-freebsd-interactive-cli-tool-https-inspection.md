As you can't believe, we are currently in an era where productivity is achieved more through smart work than hard work. Through intelligent methods, humans continue to try to find the best, faster, easier and smarter ways to achieve maximum results.

When you are doing the task of "developing backend API", you will definitely interact with HTTP inspection. Usually people use Postman, but many developers are disappointed, because it is a bit heavy, takes up a lot of RAM and the UI is also increasingly complex and difficult.

When you lose patience, Wuuz is here to offer a solution and your work can be finished quickly. Wuzz is the best HTTP inspection interactive CLI tool out there.

In carrying out its work, Wuzz will visually examine what the HTTP protocol returns for each different HTTP argument value. Wuzz command line arguments are similar to CURL arguments, so they can be used to check or modify requests copied from browser network checkers with the "copy as cURL" feature.

Wuzz, written in Go Lang, has many advantages so it is very popular with developers. One of the advantages of Wuzz is that it saves resources, you don't need a lot of RAM to run backend API development tasks. Despite having a CLI interface, the menu is very interactive, very effective, light and fast for HTTP checks.
