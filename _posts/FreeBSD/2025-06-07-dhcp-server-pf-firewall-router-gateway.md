DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) provides automatic and static networks on client computers to obtain the configuration parameters needed to communicate with other systems in an IP (Internet Protocol)-based network. Parameters that are usually provided by a DHCP server include the assignment of IP addresses, DNS server addresses, and router addresses or default gateways.

When a client computer first connects to the internet using a DHCP Server, the DHCP server immediately broadcasts a request to the local network for configuration information. The DHCP Server then answers this request with the parameters specified in the DHCP server configuration. The client computer directly applies the configuration specified by the DHCP Server to the network interface to communicate with other networks in one IP Address subnet.

DHCP servers generally assign IP addresses in one of two ways, static or dynamic. The static method allocates IP addresses to clients based on the client's hardware MAC address. This IP address will remain unchanged. Meanwhile, dynamic IP addresses are rented addresses, there is a time when the lease expires. The DHCP server assigns IP addresses from a pool or range defined by the administrator. The dynamic IP will be returned to the pool when the client disconnects from the network. If the same client rejoins the network, it may be assigned a different IP address if the previously assigned address is not available.

DHCP first appeared in October 1993 as a replacement for BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol). Version 1 of the ISC-DHCP server was released by Ted Lemon in December 1997. The ISC-DHCP implementation remains one of the most popular and powerful open source DHCP solutions.

## 2. ISC-DHCP Server Installation

On FreeBSD systems ISC DHCP Server can be installed via the Ports system or with the pkg package. In this article we will explain how to install the ISC DHCP Server using the pkg package. The first thing you have to do is update the pkg package.

```console
root@ns1:~ # pkg update -f
root@ns1:~ # pkg upgrade -f
```
The update function above is to get the latest version of the DHCP Server application. After that, type the command below to install the DHCP Server.

```console
root@ns1:~ # pkg install isc-dhcp44-client
root@ns1:~ # pkg install isc-dhcp44-relay
root@ns1:~ # pkg delete isc-dhcp44-server

```
When you have finished installing the DHCP Server, an article will appear containing recommendations for configuring the DHCP Server. We will use these recommendations as a benchmark for configuring the DHCP server.


## 3. ISC-DHCP Server Configuration

Once the installation is complete, continue with configuring the DHCP Server. The first step that must be taken is to create an rc.d script, so that the DHCP server can be booted automatically when the computer is restarted/rebooted. Add the script below to the `/etc/rc.conf` file.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
hostname="ns1"
ifconfig_nfe0="inet 192.168.5.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
ifconfig_vr0="inet 192.168.7.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
defaultrouter="192.168.5.1"
gateway_enable="YES"

dhcpd_enable="YES"
#dhcpd_flags="-q -early_chroot"
dhcpd_conf="/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf"
#dhcpd_ifaces="rl0"
dhcpd_withumask="022"
#dhcpd_chuser_enable="YES"
dhcpd_withuser="dhcpd"
dhcpd_withgroup="dhcpd"
#dhcpd_chroot_enable="YES"
dhcpd_devfs_enable="YES"
dhcpd_rootdir="/var/db/dhcpd"
```
The main configuration file is `dhcpd.conf`, from the script above it is clear that the file is located at `/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf`. Edit the `/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf` file, as in the example below.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf
# dhcpd.conf
#
# Sample configuration file for ISC dhcpd
#

# option definitions common to all supported networks...
option domain-name "unixexplore.com";
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8;
option domain-search-list code 119 = text;
option arch code 93 = unsigned integer 16;
option ldap-server code 95 = text;

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

# Use this to enble / disable dynamic dns updates globally.
#ddns-update-style none;

# If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local
# network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented.
authoritative;
one-lease-per-client true;
deny duplicates;
update-conflict-detection false;

# Use this to send dhcp log messages to a different log file (you also
# have to hack syslog.conf to complete the redirection).
log-facility local7;

# No service will be given on this subnet, but declaring it helps the 
# DHCP server to understand the network topology.

subnet 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}

# This is a very basic subnet declaration.

subnet 192.168.7.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.7.2 192.168.7.250;
        option routers 192.168.7.1;
		option broadcast-address 192.168.7.255;
		option domain-name "unixexplore.com";
		option domain-search "ns1.unixexplore.com";
        option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 9.9.9.9;
}

# This declaration allows BOOTP clients to get dynamic addresses,
# which we don't really recommend.

#subnet 10.254.239.32 netmask 255.255.255.224 {
#  range dynamic-bootp 10.254.239.40 10.254.239.60;
#  option broadcast-address 10.254.239.31;
#  option routers rtr-239-32-1.example.org;
#}

# A slightly different configuration for an internal subnet.
#subnet 10.5.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.224 {
#  range 10.5.5.26 10.5.5.30;
#  option domain-name-servers ns1.internal.example.org;
#  option domain-name "internal.example.org";
#  option routers 10.5.5.1;
#  option broadcast-address 10.5.5.31;
#  default-lease-time 600;
#  max-lease-time 7200;
#}

# Hosts which require special configuration options can be listed in
# host statements.   If no address is specified, the address will be
# allocated dynamically (if possible), but the host-specific information
# will still come from the host declaration.

#host passacaglia {
#  hardware ethernet 0:0:c0:5d:bd:95;
#  filename "vmunix.passacaglia";
#  server-name "toccata.example.com";
#}

# Fixed IP addresses can also be specified for hosts.   These addresses
# should not also be listed as being available for dynamic assignment.
# Hosts for which fixed IP addresses have been specified can boot using
# BOOTP or DHCP.   Hosts for which no fixed address is specified can only
# be booted with DHCP, unless there is an address range on the subnet
# to which a BOOTP client is connected which has the dynamic-bootp flag
# set.
#host fantasia {
#  hardware ethernet 08:00:07:26:c0:a5;
#  fixed-address fantasia.example.com;
#}

# You can declare a class of clients and then do address allocation
# based on that.   The example below shows a case where all clients
# in a certain class get addresses on the 10.17.224/24 subnet, and all
# other clients get addresses on the 10.0.29/24 subnet.

#class "foo" {
#  match if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 4) = "SUNW";
#}

#shared-network 224-29 {
#  subnet 10.17.224.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
#    option routers rtr-224.example.org;
#  }
#  subnet 10.0.29.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
#    option routers rtr-29.example.org;
#  }
#  pool {
#    allow members of "foo";
#    range 10.17.224.10 10.17.224.250;
#  }
#  pool {
#    deny members of "foo";
#    range 10.0.29.10 10.0.29.230;
#  }
#}
```
What you need to pay attention to when editing the dhcpd.conf file is the IP address for the LAN or local/private network. In the dhcpd.conf script above the IP for the LAN is in the subnet `192.168.7.0` netmask `255.255.255.0` with the range `192.168.7.2 192.168.7.250`. When the dhcpd.conf file configuration has been completed, it is time to test the DHCP server, whether it is RUNNING or not.

Next, create a log file, this file is useful for controlling DHCP server activity. With a log file, monitoring can be done at any time and when needed. Enter the following script in the `/etc/syslog.conf` and `/etc/newsyslog.conf` files.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/syslog.conf
local7.*					/var/log/dhcpd.log
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/newsyslog.conf
/var/log/dhcpd.log                      600  7     *    @T00  JC
```
Create a log file in the `/var/log` folder.

```console
root@ns1:~ # touch /var/log/dhcpd.log
```
If a log file has been created, provide file ownership rights and permissions.

```console
root@ns1:~ # chown -R dhcpd:dhcpd /var/db/dhcpd/
root@ns1:~ # chown -R dhcpd:dhcpd /var/log/dhcpd.log
```


## 4. Packet File (PF) Firewall configuration

If you haven't missed any steps to configure the ISC-DHCP Server, continue by configuring the Firewall Packet Filter. This firewall is used to regulate incoming and outgoing traffic, which ones must pass through and which ones must be blocked. Before creating Packet Filter rules, first activate the PF Firewall kernel module. In the file `/usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC`, type the following script and place it at the bottom of the `GENERIC` file.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC
options         ALTQ
options         ALTQ_CBQ
options         ALTQ_RED
options         ALTQ_RIO
options         ALTQ_HFSC
options         ALTQ_PRIQ
device	    pf
device	    pflog
device	    pfsync
```
Build and install the file `/usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC` which has been included in the kernel Packet Filter module.

```console
root@ns1:~ # cd /usr/src
root@ns1:/usr/src # make buildkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC
root@ns1:/usr/src # make installkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC
```
The process is a bit long, wait until the build and install `GENERIC` kernel process is complete. After that, continue by creating Packet Filter Firewall rules. In the `/etc/rc.conf` file, add the following script to automatically boot PF Firewall.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
pf_enable="YES" # Enable PF (load module if required)
pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"
pf_flags="" # additional flags for pfctl startup
pflog_enable="YES" # start pflogd(8)
pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog" # where pflogd should store the logfile
pflog_flags="" # additional flags for pflogd startup
pflogd_enable="YES"
pfsync_enable="YES"
```
Create a file `/etc/pf.conf` and enter the script below.

```console
root@ns1:~ # touch /etc/pf.conf
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/pf.conf
set limit table-entries 400000

After all applications have been configured and nothing has been missed, restart all the applications that we have configured.

```console
root@ns1:~ # service isc-dhcpd restart
root@ns1:~ # service syslogd restart
root@ns1:~ # service pf restart
```
If you didn't miss anything in the above configuration, at this point you should have a FreeBSD Router Gateway with PF Firewall. Now you can enable your Windows clients with Static IP or dynamic IP obtained from DHCP Server.

Even with the above configuration, your FreeBSD Router Gateway is up and running, but it seems incomplete if DNS server is not installed. Please choose the appropriate DNS server, BIND or Unbound, all are equally good according to your network system needs.
