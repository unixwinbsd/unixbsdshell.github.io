Firewalls allow for filtering of traffic entering and leaving a system. Firewalls use one or more sets of "rules" to evaluate network packets as they enter or exit a network connection and allow or disallow the traffic. Firewall rules examine one or more packet attributes, including protocol type, source/destination host addresses, and source/destination ports.

IPFIREWALL (IPFW) is a FreeBSD-sponsored firewall software application written and maintained by volunteer FreeBSD staff members. IPFW uses legacy stateless rules and legacy rule coding techniques to achieve what is called Simple Stateful logic.

IPFW's stateless rule syntax is empowered with technically advanced selection capabilities that far exceed the knowledge level of the average firewall installer. IPFW is intended for professional users or advanced computer hobbyists with advanced packet selection requirements. A high-level, detailed understanding of how different protocols use and construct their unique packet header information is required before the power of IPFW rules can be unleashed. Providing that level of explanation is beyond the scope of this section of the handbook.

IPFW consists of seven components, the primary components being the kernel firewall filter rule processor and integrated packet counting facility, the logging facility, the NAT redirect rule trigger facility, and the advanced special-purpose facility, the dummynet traffic shaping facility, the forward 'fwd rule' facility, the bridge facility, and the ipstealth facility.

In this article, we will discuss NAT configuration using the IPFW Firewall. Before we delve further, let's briefly explain NAT. Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process of mapping one Internet Protocol (IP) address to another by modifying the IP packet header as it passes through a router. This helps improve security and reduce the number of used IP addresses.

Why is NAT essential for internet access? As we know, accessing the internet requires a public IP address; computers with private IP addresses cannot access the internet. So, why can our home computers access the internet, but not computers with private IP addresses? NAT is the answer. With NAT, home computers or computers with private IP addresses can access the internet.

## 1. System Requirements
- OS: FreeBSD 13.2 Stable
- Land Card IP nfe0: 192.168.5.2/24 (WAN Network)
- IP Land Card vr0: 192.168.7.1/24 (LAN Network)
- Default Router: 192.168.5.1
- CPU: AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 955 Processor


## 2. Kernel Configuration
The first step in configuring NAT on a FreeBSD computer is to enable the kernel required for the IPFW Firewall. Add the script below to the `GENERIC` file.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC
options         IPFIREWALL
options         ROUTETABLES=7
options         DUMMYNET
options         HZ="1000"
options         IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE  # enables logging for rules with log keyword to syslogd(8)
options         IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=17  # limits number of logged packets per-entry
options         IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT # sets default policy to pass what is not explicitly denied
options         IPFIREWALL_NAT  # enables basic in-kernel NAT support
options         LIBALIAS  # enables full in-kernel NAT support
options         IPFIREWALL_NAT64  # enables in-kernel NAT64 support
options         IPFIREWALL_NPTV6  # enables in-kernel IPv6 NPT support
options         IPFIREWALL_PMOD  # enables protocols modification module support
options         IPDIVERT  # enables NAT through natd(8)
options         IPSTEALTH
options         DEVICE_POLLING
options         MROUTING
device          coretemp
```
The `"options"` option in the above script enables the kernel required by the IPFW Firewall. You can place this script at the end of the GENERIC file. For a complete discussion of FreeBSD kernel configuration, you can read our previous article. Then, proceed to build and install the kernel. Type the following script.

```console
root@ns1:~ # cd /usr/src
root@ns1:/usr/src # make buildkernel && make installkernel && reboot
```


## 3. Configure the IP Address
After the computer has finished rebooting and restarted, continue configuring the IP address in the `/etc/rc.conf` file. Since we're using two Land Cards in this tutorial, each Land Card must have a designated IP address. Type the following script into the `/etc/rc.conf` file.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
ifconfig_nfe0="inet 192.168.5.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
ifconfig_vr0="inet 192.168.7.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
defaultrouter="192.168.5.1"
gateway_enable="YES"

firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_type="open"
#firewall_script="/etc/ipfw.rules"
#firewall_script="/etc/ipfw2.rules"
#firewall_script="/etc/ipfw3.rules"
#firewall_script="/etc/ipfw4.rules"
firewall_script="/etc/ipfw5.rules"
firewall_logging="YES"
firewall_logif="YES"

natd_enable="YES"
natd_interface="nfe0"  #Land Card WAN My Indihome
natd_flags="-dynamic -m"
```
In the script, the IP Address nfe0 is taken from the FiberHome My Indihome router `192.168.5.2` and the IP Address vr0 for the Local/Private network is `192.168.7.1`. For the default router, we use the gateway from the Fiber Home My Indihome modem, which is `192.168.5.1`. natd_enable to enable NAT on the router and gateway_enable to enable the gateway on the FreeBSD machine we are setting. Usually for the local/private network gateway on Land Card VR0, the gateway IP is the IP originating from Land Card `VR0`, which is `192.168.7.1`.


## 4. Configure the IPFW Firewall

Once all the above configurations are complete, proceed to configuring the IPFW Firewall. Below are some examples of `/etc/ipfw.rules` files that you can use and apply to your FreeBSD router.

**Sample script 1 /etc/ipfw.rules**

```console
#!/bin/sh
wan="nfe0"
lan="vr0"
wan_int="192.168.5.2"
lan_int="192.168.7.1"
ipfw="/sbin/ipfw -q"

# ?????????? ??? ???????:
${ipfw} -f flush
${ipfw} -f pipe flush
${ipfw} -f queue flush

${ipfw} add allow ip from any to any via lo0
${ipfw} add deny ip from any to 127.0.0.0/8
${ipfw} add deny ip from 127.0.0.0/8 to any

${ipfw} add divert natd ip from any to any via nfe0
${ipfw} add allow ip from any to any

Please select one of the five IPFW Firewall script examples above. Don't worry, all scripts have been tested and validated, and all scripts run normally, and the FreeBSD 13.2 router engine is stable. The above scripts can also be used on previous FreeBSD versions, namely FreeBSD 12, 11, 10.9, and 8. If all the configurations above don't miss any NAT and the gateway should be running normally, but it's still not perfect, why?

You need to add the ISC-DHCP application so that each client can automatically obtain an IP address (dynamic) or static (static IP). It would be even more complete if your FreeBSD router also has BIND or Unbound installed as a DNS server. If you encounter any difficulties or problems configuring NAT, please send us an email.
