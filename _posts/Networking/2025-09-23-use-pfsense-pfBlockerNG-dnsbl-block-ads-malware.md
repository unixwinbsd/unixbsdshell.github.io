pfBlockerNG has been around since 2018 and is a free and open-source distributed package. Since its inception, pfBlockerNG DNSBL has been built specifically for the PFSense Router software. With the pfBlockerNG DNSBL feature, PFSense is capable of blocking ads, blocking harmful content such as gambling and alcohol, and other noteworthy features, including pfBlockerNG's geo-blocking capabilities with the help of MaxMid.

By adding the pfBlockerNG package to your PFSense Router, you've blocked ads and also been able to block web tracking, ransomware, and malware. When you activate pfBlockerNG, you immediately gain additional network security and privacy, as your entire PFSense system is protected by pfBlockerNG with the help of the DNSBL (Domain Name System-based Blackhole List) feature.

The pfBlockerNG package can also block the internet from specific IP addresses. You can select IP addresses from specific countries or regions that you want to block. This can be beneficial because IP address restrictions make it harder for hackers to infiltrate your system.

In this article, we'll explain how to use DNSBL from the pfBlockerNG package to remove ads and block malware and spamware. In this article, we'll use PFSense version 2.7.2-RELEASE (amd64).

## 1. Installing the pfBlockerNG DNSBL package

Before installing pfBlockerNG, make sure you have enabled the Unbound DNS server (DNS Resolver). If not, enable the DNS resolver first. You can read the previous article on how to enable the Unbound DNS server in PFSense.

However, to set up pfBlockerNG, you'll need to enable the Python package in DNS Resolver. See the image below for instructions on enabling the Python package in DNS Resolver.
