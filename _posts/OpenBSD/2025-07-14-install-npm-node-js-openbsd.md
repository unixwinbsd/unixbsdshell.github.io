Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling developers to build scalable network applications. Together with Node Package Manager (NPM), the default package manager for Node.js, developers can manage dependencies and publish their packages.

This article provides a complete guide to installing Node.js and NPM on OpenBSD systems, ensuring developers can get their Node.js projects up and running efficiently.

## B. What is Node.js
Think of Node.js as a loyal companion in your programming adventures, not just another character in your story, but a key ally that brings your innovative ideas to life beyond conventional web narratives. It's like discovering a hidden path that suddenly opens up, allowing you to build responsive and dynamic applications like the plot of a mystery novel.

Node.js has the unique ability to transform the complex into the achievable, making application development not just a possibility but an enjoyable journey.

## C. Node.js Architecture
Node.JS excels at efficiently managing large numbers of concurrent connections and data-intensive tasks. Node.JS is ideal for tasks involving rapid processing of large amounts of data. However, Node.JS is less suitable for computationally intensive tasks that require significant CPU resources. In such cases, Node.JS's single-threaded nature can cause delays in responding to other requests.

To better illustrate this concept, imagine a coffee shop/caf√©. In a multi-process configuration, each client (application server) is served by a different barista (thread). If all the baristas are busy, new customers will arrive in anticipation.

<br/>

In contrast, Node.JS is like a coffee shop with a highly efficient barista. This barista processes orders quickly and in a continuous flow, much like Node.JS handles requests using non-blocking I/O operations.

However, complex orders in this setup are like a very CPU-intensive task in Node.JS. They require more of the barista's time, slowing down service to others. This shows how Node.JS, while excellent for fast, voluminous applications, can struggle with CPU-intensive tasks.

The difference between single-threaded and multi-process is simple: a single-threaded architecture can run and scale faster than a multi-process configuration. This is what [Ryan Dahl](https://www.infoq.com/interviews/node-ryan-dahl/) had in mind when he created Node.JS.


## D. Installing Node.JS and NPM
Now that you know a little about Node.JS, let's move on to installing it. Unlike similar systems like FreeBSD, installing Node.JS on OpenBSD is incredibly easy.

Before we begin installing Node.JS, it's best to install the Node.JS dependencies. There are several dependencies you'll need to install, and one of the most important is Python.

```console
ns2# pkg_add python
ns2# pkg_add flock gmake
ns2# pkg_add gcc g++ llvm py3-llvm gas
```
After all your dependencies are installed, then we continue by installing Node.JS.

```console
ns2# pkg_add node
```
Once you've successfully installed Node.JS, let's continue by checking the application version. This will ensure that Node.JS is installed on your OpenBSD system.

```console
ns2# node -v
v20.18.2

ns2# npm -v
11.1.0
```
At this point, you have successfully installed Node.JS on OpenBSD. Your Node.JS is now ready to be used to create a wide variety of applications.

## E. Examples of Using Node.JS and NPM
To complete this article, we'll provide a few examples of how to use NPM and Node.JS on OpenBSD.


```console
ns2# npm i @esbuild/openbsd-x64
```
Even though npm is included in the Node.js installation, npm updates more frequently than Node.js, so you should always update to the latest version!.

```console
ns2# npm install npm@latest -g
ns2# npm update -g npm
```
<br/>

```console
ns2# npm install -g node@latest --force
```
With Node.js and NPM installed on your OpenBSD 7.6 system, you're now ready to start building applications with Node.js. Remember to keep your Node.js and NPM versions up-to-date to take advantage of the latest features and security updates. If you find managing your Node.js infrastructure challenging, consider hiring remote DevOps engineers to streamline the process and ensure your environment is always optimized for performance and security.
