In a simple file sharing scheme, there are users and a server that receives files from one user and allows other users to download them. There are two drawbacks in this scenario: the bandwidth of the distribution server network and the centralization factor. The server's network channel can provide good download speed for several users, for example, hundreds, but if you imagine that thousands of people are downloading from the same server at the same time, the download speed will decrease.

You can also mention the speed of the server's hard drive, which in some cases contributes to a decrease in download speed no worse than a weak network channel. All these are consequences of a centralized architecture, the main danger of which lies in the fact that the server's exit from the network is equivalent to the loss of the ability to download the files it stores.

BitTorrent is the most common protocol for exchanging files peer-to-peer, that is, directly between users without relying on a central server.

[I2PSnark](https://web.archive.org/web/20180914061348/https://torrent.wonderhowto.com/how-to/untraceable-seed-torrents-anonymously-using-i2psnark-0133922/) is a bit-torrent client for working with [torrents](https://wikireality.ru/wiki/Torrent) on https://wikireality.ru/wiki/I2p installed on the router console. It looks quite minimalistic and has a basic set of functions. Please note that using I2PSnark, you can only download internal torrents of the I2P network. This is not an anonymizer and will not download what is distributed on the external Internet. Available only through the web interface.

## I2PSnark Torrent Client
For a list of torrent clients that support working via I2P, see the i2pd documentation. If you think the list is incomplete, you can add it. This article will only cover I2PSnark, as it has been the best solution for I2P torrenting for many years. In addition to decent functionality, this client is I2P-only, that is, it can work exclusively via the I2P network, which saves inexperienced users from the threat of IP address leaks.

I2PSnark appeared almost simultaneously with the I2P network itself. Until recently, this client was part of the [Java I2P router](https://geti2p.net/ru/), which included a number of applications in addition to the main function of connecting users to hidden networks. I2PSnark interacts with the I2P router via the I2CP protocol, which is supported in the lighter and faster alternative i2pd router, which runs in C++. To use I2PSnark separately from the Java router, you must use I2PSnark standalone. You can build the binary yourself from source code, or use the version from the I2P+ project, which is a soft fork of the main I2P router with minor changes. Direct links to download the standalone I2PSnark binaries are available on the [i2pd documentation page](https://i2pd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/filesharing/).

## How to Download Torrent Files with I2PSnark
Before you start downloading torrent files with i2psnark, there are several requirements that you must do, including:
- Learn to Install Java JDK on OpenBSD
- How to Install i2p routing protocol on OpenBSD
- How to Install i2pd on OpenBSD - Client for Anonymous I2P Networks

Before using I2PSnark standalone, you must enable the I2CP interface, which is disabled by default in i2pd. This is done through the **/etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf** configuration file: uncomment the enabled = true line in the [i2cp] section and restart i2pd.

```
[i2cp]
## Enable the I2CP protocol (default: false)
enabled = true
## Address and port service will listen on (default: 127.0.0.1:7654)
address = 192.168.5.3
port = 7654
```

## Adding trackers to I2P
As mentioned above, using trackers helps you detect peers, information about file parts, and various meta-data faster. The faster the peer is found, the faster the download will start. On the settings page below there is a section "Trackers", at the bottom there are three windows. Enter the data alternately in the fields.

## Get Torrent File
To download torrent using I2PSnark, you need to add a file with the extension .torrent in the file directory (see above), or add a magnet link. Usually, the download does not start immediately: the client is just starting to recognize the peer.

To get a torrent file to run in I2PSnark, you need to enable proxy in the Google chrome/Yandex web browser.

![setting proxy i2p snark di web browser](https://www.opencode.net/unixbsdshell/balena-etcher-portable-173/-/raw/main/setting_proxy_i2p_snark_di_web_browser.jpg)

After the proxy in the web browser is active, you open the site **"http://tracker2.postman.i2p/"**. Then you look for the torrent file you need to download on i2pSnark.

But, before you open the website, activate I2P and I2PD first with the following command.

```
ns2# /usr/local/bin/i2prouter restart
ns2# rcctl restart i2pd i2p
```

After I2P is active, please open the site **"http://tracker2.postman.i2p/"**.

## Running the Torrent file download process
In this process we will start downloading the torrent file that we have obtained from the site "http://tracker2.postman.i2p/". Open I2P in your browser by typing "http://192.168.5.3:7657/i2psnark/", then you select the "ADD TORRENT" button, after that take the torrent file or magnet url link that you have obtained from "http://tracker2.postman.i2p/".

I2PSnark is not the only way to do this, and it is not the fastest. However, this method is easy, already in, and more than capable of uploading files quickly.
