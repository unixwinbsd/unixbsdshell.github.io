OBS stands for Open Broadcaster Software, a free, open source live video production software supported by a large community of developers from around the world. OBS can be used for live video production, live streaming, and video recording.

When you first download and install OBS, the setup wizard will ask if you want to optimize the software for recording or live streaming because OBS has the ability to combine many different audio visual sources into a live video production environment.

OBS Studio also supports many plugins that can expand its functionality to include features such as NDI support, VST plugins, and stream deck control. OBS Studio plugins are software add-ons that are installed on the program to enable more features. In the case of OBS Studio, users have to install the plugin manually.

Plugins in OBS Studio are usually new sources in the sources list. However, some of them may even install an entirely new tab or dock to your program. It completely depends on the functionality of the plugin.

The plugin function in OBS Studio is used to extend OBS functionality by adding custom code written to perform specific tasks. The most popular OBS plugins add support for NDI, which is an IP video production protocol. Another popular plugin is called VirtualCam, which lets you capture any video within OBS and connect it to another camera via a virtual webcam source.

Typically independent developers identify areas that can be improved within OBS Studio and code solutions for them. They then host the files for their new software online, and OBS users can download and install them into their OBS Studio directory.

Who uses OBS Studio. gamers, content creators, and online educators regularly use software to record content such as gameplay, tutorials, vlogs, and more. The program can also broadcast live video to popular streaming platforms and provides the option to customize the look and feel of the stream with themes, transitions, and other elements.

On this occasion, we will try to discuss how to install OBS Studio on a UNIX BSD based system. In this case we will try to install OBS Studio into the FReeBSD Desktop System.

Because there are so many FreeBSD Desktop variants, this article will explain how to install OBS Studio on a `GhostBSD system`, one of the Desktop-based FreeBSD variants with a charming GUI display.

## 1. System Specifications
- OS: GhostBSD 23.06.01
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 @ 2.83GHz
- Memory: 4 GB
- OBS version: obs-studio-29.1.3_2

## 2. OBS Studio Dependencies
Dependencies are library files required to install `OBS Studio`. This library file is very important for a program to run perfectly on the FreeBSD system. There are several dependencies that must be installed before you install OBS Studio. The following are the dependencies that must be installed on GhostBSD.

```console
root@ns3:~ # pkg install cmake ninja pkgconf curl ccache

## 3. OBS Studio installation
After the above dependencies are installed, we continue by installing the main program, namely OBS Studio. To install OBS Studio on Ghost BSD you must log in as a root user. Follow these steps to install OBS Studio.

```yml
root@ns3:~ # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster # make install clean
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade # make install clean
```

The command above is used to prepare [updates and upgrades to the ports system](https://www.inchimediatama.org/2025/02/update-paket-pkg-freebsd-14-dengan.html) on GhosBSD. After both programs are installed, continue by updating the GhostBSD system ports.

```yml
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade # portmaster -af
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade # portupgrade -af
```

The `portupgrade -af and portmaster -af` scripts are for updating the GhostBSD ports system. After completing the ports update, we can immediately install OBS Studio. The following are the commands to install OBS Studio.

```yml
root@ns3:/usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade # cd /usr/ports/multimedia/obs-studio
root@ns3:/usr/ports/multimedia/obs-studio # make install clean
```

On GhostBSD, sometimes the installation using the ports system is unsuccessful or errors often occur. If the installation fails with the ports system, we can try installing OBS Studio with the FreeBSD pkg package. Here's how to install it.

```console
root@ns3:/usr/ports/multimedia/obs-studio # pkg install obs-studio

	luajit-devel: 2.1.0.20230712
	obs-studio: 29.1.3_2

Number of packages to be removed: 1
Number of packages to be installed: 2

The process will require 30 MiB more space.

```

After OBS Studio is installed, we continue by typing the following command in the `/etc/rc.conf` file.

```console
root@ns3:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
kld_list="cuse4bsd"
webcamd_enable="YES"
```

The command above is used to activate the webcam plugin, so that OBS Studio can record using the webcam.


## 4. How to Run OBS Studio
On GhsotBSD, running OBS Studio is very easy, on the GhostBSD Desktop display, right click the mouse and select the "Open in Terminal" menu. After entering the Ghost BSD command shell menu, type the command "obs" followed by the "enter" key on the keyboard.

```console
semeru@ns3:/usr/home/semeru/Desktop $ obs
```

Then the OBS Studio program will appear on your monitor screen.

OBS Studio is a great program for advanced users. The program can be configured to suit your needs as a recording program and even create professional-level final products for sites like YouTube and Twitch.
