OpenSSH is a set of open source utilities that implements the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. SSH is a secure version of telnet. SSH provides administrators and users with access to remote systems as if they were physically present at the console. SSH uses encryption to prevent eavesdropping on the connection made between the client and server. OpenSSH has 87 percent of the remote console market. OpenSSH is very practical and can be applied to all Linux and BSD distributions, as well as Apple Mac OS.

The SSH protocol was first developed in 1995 by Tatu Ylonen, a researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology. Ylonen founded SSH Communications Security in late 1995 to develop and market SSH. His company currently markets the SSH Server/Client Tectia. OpenSSH was originally created by the OpenBSD team as part of the OpenBSD 2.6 release in December 1999.

The team used code from Tatu Ylonen's SSH project, which was originally open source. Bug fixes and feature additions were made to the OpenSSH release. Soon after the release of OpenSSH, its developers decided to split into two teams.

One group concentrated on developing OpenSSH for OpenBSD while the other group developed a portable version of OpenSSH for use on other platforms. The portable edition has a P appended to it to indicate this. OpenSSH continues to be developed by the OpenBSD team led by its founder, Theo de Raadt.


In this article, we will explain about OpenSSH, specifically related to installing and configuring OpenSSH on FreeBSD system. OpenSSH is part of the standard FreeBSD distribution. In this article, we will replace the base version with a newer version of OpenSSH taken from the FreeBSD ports collection. To start the OpenSSH installation process, type the following command line.


```console
root@ns1:~ # cd /usr/ports/security/openssh-portable
root@ns1:/usr/ports/security/openssh-portable # make -D WITH_OVERWRITE_BASE install clean
```
Once the installation is complete, it's time to configure OpenSSH for use on your FreeBSD system. Add the `"NO_OPENSSH = YES"` script to the `/etc/make.conf` file in `/etc`. This script is useful for telling make not to build a base version of OpenSSH and preventing the system from downgrading to an older base version of OpenSSH.

```console
root@ns1:/usr/ports/security/openssh-portable # echo "NO_OPENSSH = YES" >> /etc/make.conf
```
The next step is to delete the FreeBSD system's default SSH folder, namely the `/etc/ssh` folder, then we replace it with a symlink from the folder in "/usr/local/etc/ssh".

```console
root@ns1:/usr/ports/security/openssh-portable # rm -rf /etc/ssh
root@ns1:/usr/ports/security/openssh-portable # ln -s /usr/local/etc/ssh /etc
```
After the symlink creation process is complete, we continue by creating the Startup rc.d script, which is used to start the OpenSSH Server automatically when the computer is turned on. To create the Startup rc.d, we edit the `/etc/rc.conf` file and add the following script to the `/etc/rc.conf` file.

```console
root@ns1:/usr/ports/security/openssh-portable # ee /etc/rc.conf
sshd_enable="NO"
openssh_enable="YES"
openssh_flags=""
openssh_pidfile="/var/run/sshd.pid"
```
Next we edit the SSH configuration file, namely the `/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.

```console
root@ns1:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/ssh
root@ns1:/usr/local/etc/ssh # ee sshd_config

In the above script OpenSSH runs on `port 22` and uses our FreeBSD server's internal/private IP address, which is `192.168.5.2`.


## 1. Creating OpenSSH Keys

SSH servers authenticate clients using a number of different techniques. The most commonly used authentication mechanisms are passwords and SSH keys. While passwords provide protection against unauthorized access, SSH keys are by far the most secure. The problem with passwords is that they are often created manually and are not long enough and complex enough.

Therefore, hacker attacks can compromise their security. SSH keys provide a consistently secure option. Each SSH key pair consists of a private key and a matching public key, and can be used in place of a password for authentication. Follow the steps below to create OpenSSH keys.


```console
root@ns1:~ # ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):  tekan ENTER
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): masukkan password
Enter same passphrase again:  masukkan password
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:0RflgIyj4gSxDsASSTM3UQsMgYLDO2GYm8lnejbNbXY root@router2
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|XX=*o.   o .o..  |
|@==oo . o.o  +   |
|*=+. . .... . .  |
|+* oo .  . .     |
|  *oo.. S        |
| . +.o + E       |
|  o . o .        |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The script command above will create a new folder `/root/.ssh`, which contains the `id_rsa` file (private key) and the `id_rsa.pub` file (public key). Once the key creation is complete, proceed to install the public SSH key used for the remote console.

```console
root@ns1:~ # cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@ns1.unixexplore.com "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
The authenticity of host 'router2.unixexplore.com (192.168.9.3)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:cUadBvuFWb38iZ0cdUR8NtkOehQg8vZ3Vh7MWUTaXI0.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:1: router2
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'router2.unixexplore.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
                                                               #####
                                                                #######

(root@ns1.unixexplore.com) Password for root@router2:  ketikkan password root
root@ns1:~ #
```
The next step is to connect the SSH server using the private key, here is a sample script.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p 22 root@ns1.unixexplore.com
                                                               #####
                                                                #######
                   #                                            ##O#O##
  ######          ###                                           #VVVVV#
    ##             #                                          ##  VVV  ##
    ##         ###    ### ####   ###    ###  ##### #####     #          ##
    ##        #  ##    ###    ##  ##     ##    ##   ##      #            ##
    ##       #   ##    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###        #            ###
    ##          ###    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###       QQ#           ##Q
    ##       # ###     ##     ##  ##     ##     ## ##    QQQQQQ#       #QQQQQQ
    ##      ## ### #   ##     ##  ###   ###    ##   ##   QQQQQQQ#     #QQQQQQQ
  ############  ###   ####   ####   #### ### ##### #####   QQQQQ#######QQQQQ
Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa': masukkan password
```

If a passphrase is used, the user will be prompted every time a connection is made to the server. You can use ssh-agent and ssh-add to load SSH keys into memory and eliminate the need to enter the passphrase every time. ssh-agent handles authentication using the private key entered into it. ssh-agent can be used to run a shell or window manager, among other applications.

To use ssh-agent in a shell, pass it the shell as a command parameter. Add an identity by running ssh-add and passing it the private key passphrase. The user will then be able to ssh to any host with the public key attached.


```console
root@ns1:~ # ssh-agent csh
root@ns1:~ # ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /root/.ssh/id_rsa: masukkan kata sandi
Identity added: /root/.ssh/id_rsa (root@ns1)
```
After the OpenSSH key is created, continue by creating the OpenSSH Banner file. We name the Banner file `"banner"` and place it in the `/usr/local/etc/ssh` folder and in the `/usr/local/etc/ssh/banner` file we insert the script below.

```console
root@ns1:~ # touch /usr/local/etc/ssh/banner
root@ns1:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/ssh/banner
                                                               #####
                                                                #######
                   #                                            ##O#O##
  ######          ###                                           #VVVVV#
    ##             #                                          ##  VVV  ##
    ##         ###    ### ####   ###    ###  ##### #####     #          ##
    ##        #  ##    ###    ##  ##     ##    ##   ##      #            ##
    ##       #   ##    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###        #            ###
    ##          ###    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###       QQ#           ##Q
    ##       # ###     ##     ##  ##     ##     ## ##    QQQQQQ#       #QQQQQQ
    ##      ## ### #   ##     ##  ###   ###    ##   ##   QQQQQQQ#     #QQQQQQQ
  ############  ###   ####   ####   #### ### ##### #####   QQQQQ#######QQQQQ
```
Now enable the OpenSSH server, is it running or not?.

```console
root@ns1:~ # service openssh restart
Performing sanity check on openssh configuration.
Stopping openssh.
Waiting for PIDS: 2481.
Performing sanity check on openssh configuration.
Starting openssh.
root@ns1:~ #
```
If it looks like the one above, then the OpenSSH server is running properly.


## 2. Log In With Multi User

One of the advantages of the FreeBSD server is that it can create many users and groups. Each user can connect to the OpenSSH server and can access the FreeBSD system. We do not explain how to create users and groups in this article, you can read the previous article that discusses the technique of creating users and groups in FreeBSD.

In this article we assume the FreeBSD server has users and groups with the following names:


User Name                   User Password
udin                                routerudin
anto                                routeranto
jaka                                routerjaka
sari                                 routersari

Let's give an example, for example user Udin wants to access the OpenSSH server, use the following script.

```console
root@ns1:~ # ssh udin@ns1.unixexplore.com
                                                              #####
                                                                #######
                   #                                            ##O#O##
  ######          ###                                           #VVVVV#
    ##             #                                          ##  VVV  ##
    ##         ###    ### ####   ###    ###  ##### #####     #          ##
    ##        #  ##    ###    ##  ##     ##    ##   ##      #            ##
    ##       #   ##    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###        #            ###
    ##          ###    ##     ##  ##     ##      ###       QQ#           ##Q
