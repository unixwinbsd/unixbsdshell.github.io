excerpt: By adding the pfBlockerNG package to your PFSense Router, you've blocked ads and also been able to block web tracking, ransomware, and malware. When you activate pfBlockerNG, you immediately gain additional network security and privacy, as your entire PFSense system is protected by pfBlockerNG with the help of the DNSBL (Domain Name System-based Blackhole List) feature
